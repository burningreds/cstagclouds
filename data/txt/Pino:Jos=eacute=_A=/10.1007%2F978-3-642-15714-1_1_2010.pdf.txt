Abstract. This paper presents a meta-analysis of the CRIWG conference. The 
study is organized in three main sections: bibliometric analysis, analysis of references 
and subject analysis. The bibliometric analysis indicates that CRIWG is 
significantly  above  the  average  citation  index  of  similar  papers  published  in 
LNCS. The analysis of references shows a significant dependence on ACM papers 
 and  very  low  cross-referencing  between  CRIWG  papers.  The  subject 
analysis  reveals  that  CRIWG  slightly  favors  positivist  evaluations,  although 
almost half of the papers do not present any type of evaluation. We conclude 
this  study  with  a  discussion  over  strengths,  weaknesses,  opportunities  and 
threats.  

Keywords: Meta-analysis, CRIWG review.  

1   Introduction 

This  paper  is  intended  for  the  16th  edition  of  the  CRIWG1  conference.  As  a  round 
number (24), it may trigger an appropriate time to reflect on the past contributions of 
this conference and the outlook for the future. The authors would then like to present 
some data gathered  from the  previous proceedings and elaborate some analysis and 
discussion. We expect this to be the starting point of a rich and controversial interchange 
of viewpoints during the conference itself.  

CRIWG started in Lisbon, Portugal, in September 1995. It was initially thought to 
be  a  meeting  to  exchange  research  approaches  in  the  field  of  Groupware  for  a  few 
groups. Instead of establishing an informal gathering, a decision was made to make it 
scientifically  valid  through  the  commonly  accepted  peer-reviewing  process,  using 
anonymous  submissions and  reviews, and circulating the papers in proceedings distributed 
by international scientific publishers. The conference has kept this tradition 
up to now.  

CRIWG  has  some  unique  features  when  compared  with  other  conferences  in  the 
field. It has just one track, with full papers and work-in-progress ones. The presentation 
of  the  papers  provides  ample  time  for  discussion,  giving  thus  authors  very  valuable 
                                                           
1 Which now is an acronym for the Collaboration Researchers International Working Group on 

Groupware.

feedback.  The  conference  also  encourages  social  interaction  among  participants.  Finally,
 the conference has been organized in interesting places around the world, but this 
has not been obstacle to sustained presence by participants to all sessions.  

We will present some data extracted from the proceedings, we will analyze it and 
try to make suggestions for the future of the conference. The analysis, of course, is the 
authors’ responsibility and it does not represent an official statement from the conference 
committees.  

2   Methodology 

Most of this review is based on information provided by Thomson Reuters ISI Conference 
Proceedings Citation Index (ISI, for short). We analyzed all CRIWG papers 
published between 2000 and 2008. Our intention was to cover the set of proceedings 
published by LNCS and IEEE between 1999 and 2009. However, for some unknown 
reason the joint SPIRE/CRIWG 1999 conference was not found in ISI; and the 2009 
papers were not yet available in December 2009, when the data was gathered.  

Gathering the list of papers from ISI was not completely straightforward, requiring 
combined  searches  using  the  CRIWG  acronym  and  the  Groupware  keyword,  plus 
manual inspection to remove spurious references to other journal and conference papers.
 The consolidated data set used in most of our analysis consists of 246 papers.  

The review was separated in three main goals: bibliometric analysis, analysis of references 
and subject analysis. The bibliometric information, such as the Hirsch index (h) 
[1], was automatically produced by ISI and gives a summative assessment of CRIWG.  
Our main purpose to analyze the CRIWG references to other papers was to understand 
how CRIWG views and positions itself relatively to other research fields. The 
references  were automatically obtained  from ISI, exported  to Endnote and exported 
again to Excel, which was then used to discover the main referenced papers, authors 
and  sources.  It  should  be  emphasized  the  references  exported  by  ISI  present  some 
shortcomings. For instance, they do not identify all authors. Furthermore, conferences 
and journals are formatted with multiple short names. A considerable effort was done 
to normalize the data and obtain the consolidated information reported in section 4.  

The  subject  analysis  follows  a  method  that  has  been  adopted  by  similar  reviews 
(e.g., [2-4]). The method uses qualitative data analysis techniques to code the data set 
using  multiple  tags  [5].  Unlike  some  reviews  that  use  a  predefined  set  of  tags,  we 
adopted  a  grounded  approach  [6]  where  the  keywords  emerge  as  the  analysis  
progresses  [5].  The  main  categories  considered  during  the  grounded  coding  were: 
research  objective,  research  topic  and  type  of  evaluation.  Two  coding  rounds  were 
performed to ensure consistency.  

The  coding  process  was  applied  to  the  246  paper  abstracts  obtained  through  ISI. 
This might be viewed as a controversial decision, since coding could instead be applied 
to the full paper bodies. The basis for our decision to only code abstracts was: 
(1) the abstracts should be considered accurate and concise summaries of the authors’ 
research,  done  by  the  persons  most  fit  to  accomplish  them,  i.e.  the  authors  themselves;
 (2) abstracts have an implicit structure that is totally aligned with the coding 
categories mentioned above; and (3) this structure is typically checked and enforced 
by peer reviewers.

During  the  coding  process  we  confirmed  the  type  of  information  we  were  
reviewing was available in the abstracts, which made the access to the remaining information 
 unnecessary.  We  nevertheless  point  out  the  search  for  more  fine-grained 
information,  including  for  instance  reviewing  which  specific  techniques,  tools  and 
algorithms were researched, would necessarily mandate a full body analysis.  

We finally note the trend lines shown in the paper are all polynomial functions. The 
R2 appearing near the trend lines was automatically calculated using Apple’s Numbers.  

3   Bibliometric Analysis 

The  total  number  of  CRIWG  papers  considered  in  the  bibliometric  analysis  is  246. 
The total number of citations to these papers is 336, which gives an average citation 
per paper of 1.37. The obtained h-index is 6.  

The distribution of citations per year is shown in Figure 1. After an expected ramp 
up of citation activity from 2002 to 2005, the number of citations has stabilized since 
2006 at an average of 48 cites/year.  

 

Fig. 1. Distribution of citations per year 

Fig. 2. Distribution of citations per paper 
(number of citations in horizontal axis) 

As shown in Figure 2, 132 papers (53%) have not received any citation. This indicates 
 that  CRIWG,  although  having  a  selection  of  good  papers,  has  to  improve  the 
selection process.  

3.1   Comparison with Other Conferences 

The information conveyed above might be difficult to analyze without a frame of reference.
 In order to create such reference we tried to compare CRIWG with other conferences 
 related  with  CRIWG  and  also  reported  by  ISI.  The  following  conferences 
were selected: COOPIS (Conference on Cooperative Information Systems, now part 
of OTM - On The Move Confederated Conferences), WET-ICE (Workshops on Enabling 
Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises), DSV (International 
Workshop  on  Design,  Specification  and  Verification  of  Interactive  Systems)  and 
CONTEXT  (International  and  Interdisciplinary  Conference  on  Modeling  and  Using 
Context). Furthermore, we also contrasted the CRIWG bibliometrics with a broad set 
of papers collected from ISI using a search for “LNCS” and “Conference”.

The results shown in Table 1 indicate that CRIWG, in terms of quality measured 
by citation indexes, is above average when compared with the other selected conferences 
(1.37 against an average of 1.28) and significantly above the average citation 
index of a large collection of papers published in LNCS.

3.4   Country Distribution 

A total of 29 countries have been represented in the conference series. Figure 3 indicates 
the internationalization ratio has slightly increased between 2000 and 2004 and 
slightly decreased in 2007 and 2008.

3.5   Collaborative Research 

Fig. 3. Internationalization (countries/year) 

 

As mentioned in the introduction, CRIWG aimed to promote the participants’ socialization.
  This  should  allow  researchers  to  meet  potential  partners  for  future  projects. 
These researchers will probably return to the CRIWG conference to present the new 
joint results. A reasonable hypothesis then is to assume the proportion of papers presented 
by researchers from two or more institutions would increase in time.  

Fig. 4. Percentage of collaborations by year

P. Antunes and J.A. Pino 

Figure  4  shows  the  evolution  of  the  number  of  collaborations  for  the  whole 
CRIWG  period  (1995-2009),  represented  as  a  percentage  of  the  number  of  papers 
published  in  each  year.  This  data  was  manually  gathered  from  the  proceedings.  It 
shows  the  proportion  of  papers  presented  by  two  or  more  research  groups  slightly 
growing in time (groups from different departments of the same university were considered 
as just one group). Of course, the contribution from the conference may not be 
the only reason for this increase. Other factors may influence this result, like appearance 
of grants supporting research from more than one country, etc. However, in our 
own personal experience, CRIWG helped us finding research partners.  

3.6   Special Issues in ISI Journals 

Table  5  summarizes  the  special  issues  in  ISI  Journals  published  with  extended  versions 
of papers presented at CRIWG conferences. The total number of papers is 46 
(18.7%  of  all  papers  published  by  the  Proceedings  in  the  2000-2008  period).  The 
number of citations is 99. The average citation  index is 2.15,  which is significantly 
higher  than  the  one  obtained  by  the  proceedings.  There  is  also  in  press  one  special 
issue of the Group Decision and Negotiation journal containing extended versions of 
papers presented at the 2008 conference.

4   Analysis of References 

The analysis of references gives a good indication of how CRIWG perceives its research 
community. The references were automatically obtained from ISI using the set

of 246 papers published between 2000 and 2008. References to technical documentation 
and web sites were manually removed from the data set.  

Table 7. Analysis of references 

Total number of cited papers: 4524 
Average number of references per paper: 19.15 (stdev: 8.6) 
References to ACM papers: 653 (14%)

Communications of ACM: 134 
 
Proceedings of ACM: 338

References to CRIWG papers: 84 (1.9%) 
References to ECSCW papers: 35 (0.8%) 
References to LNAI papers: 14 (0.3%) 

The results summarized in Table 7 indicate a significant dependence on ACM papers.
 The  data  also  indicate  very  low  cross-referencing  between  CRIWG  papers.  In 
the one hand, this shows there is very low inbreeding in the CRIWG community, but 
in the other hand it also points out a lack of community building. The number of references 
to thesis might be interpreted as indicating a focus on exploratory rather than 
summative research.

4.3   Main Referenced Research Areas 

The seven categories shown in Table 10 emerged after systematic data analysis of the 
data set using manual search. These categories may again be categorized by order of 
importance,  where CSCW (Computer Supported Cooperative Work) emerges as the 
most  important  research  area,  followed  by  Decision  Support  Systems  (DSS)  and 
Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL). It should however be noted that 
these categories cover a small percentage of the data set (more precisely, 25.6%). The 
remaining 3/4 of data could not be associated to a category.

5   Subject Analysis 

5.1   Research Objectives 

As shown in Figure 5, nine different research objectives were codified during the data 
analysis. The most prevailing research objective is prototype development, followed 
by design and theory/model building. Interestingly, although a major focus is on prototyping 
and designing collaborative systems and tools, CRIWG has not focused on 
building guidelines for developers.

5.2   Research Topics 

The data set was manually coded with the purpose to uncover the main research topics.
 The coding process was done in multiple rounds for consistency. Thirty-two research 
topics emerged after consolidation. Figures 5 and 6 show the  most and least 
significant  topics,  respectively.  Learning  stands  out  as  the  most  prevailing  research 
topic, considered by 51 papers (20%).  
 
 
 
 
 

 

Fig. 6. Research topics (most significant) 

Fig. 7. Research topics (least significant) 

We emphasize the coding process was performed at various conceptual levels before 
the main research topics were completely settled. Learning, for instance, is a code that 
actually encompasses the following sub-codes: classroom activities/ composition, online 
materials/courses,  teaching,  reflection,  infrastructure/platform,  scenarios,  processes, 
discussion  forums,  modeling  knowledge,  interdependencies/  mediation,  performance, 
attitudes,  dialectic  reasoning,  participation  and  self-organization.  Awareness,  in  turn, 
includes  the  following  sub-codes:  semantic  awareness,  situation  awareness,  document 
awareness, awareness model, group awareness, presence awareness, workspace awareness,
 and change awareness.  

After the coding process, the research topics were aggregated in main research areas.
  Five  main  areas  emerged  this  way,  covering  the  foundations  of  collaboration 

10 

P. Antunes and J.A. Pino 

support,  application  areas,  group  decision-making,  system  development  issues,  and 
communities. Table 11 shows that collaboration support is the main research concern 
expressed by CRIWG (35% of papers). It is also interesting to note that infrastructural 
issues  related  with  collaboration  support  have  not  received  sizeable  attention  from 
CRIWG researchers (10% of papers).

group support systems, negotiation, knowledge management,  
collaboration engineering) 
Systems development (integration, peer-to-peer, reusability, XML, 
patterns, software engineering) 
Communities (virtual communities, communities of practice, virtual 
worlds, online communities) 

5.3   Evaluation Methods 

Almost half of the papers (118 papers, 47.5%) do not present any type of evaluation. 
Of the adopted evaluation methods, case studies are the most prevalent one. CRIWG 
balances positivist and interpretivist evaluations, with a slight advance given to positivist 
 evaluations.  Interpretivism  addresses  questions  of  meaning  while  positivism 
addresses questions of cause and effect [7].  
 

 
47.5% - No evaluation  
 
25.2% - Positivist (laboratory, survey, 
empirical, sample application, formative, 
simulation, analytic)  
 
16.3% - Interpretivist (case study, case 
illustration) 

 

Fig. 8. Distribution of papers per evaluation method 

Trying to study the 118 papers without any evaluation, we found they are distributed 
according to Table 12.  

The large number of papers with no evaluation perhaps is related to one category 
of  papers  the  conference  has:  the  Work-in-Progress  class.  These  papers,  short  in 
length, are supposed to present initial ideas and thus may tend to be speculative, reporting 
initial stages of research projects. We could not confirm this hypothesis with 
the available data, since the proceedings do not distinguish the CRIWG type of paper.

5.4   Trends in Research Objectives 

The  trend  lines  shown  in  Figures  9-13  account  the  different  research  objectives  according 
 to  year  of  publication.  The  framework  and  architecture  topics  exhibit  trend 
lines showing that, after an increase of importance, the pursuit of these research lines 
is in decline (note also that R2 is high).  The other categories do not exhibit any definite 
trend.

5.5   Trends in Research Topics 

The  trends  shown  in  Figures  14-18  indicate  a  clearly  increasing  interest  over  the 
communities theme (comprising issues such as virtual communities, communities of 
practice, virtual worlds and online communities). The CRIWG interest over application 
development (including various issues such as integration, peer-to-peer, reusability,
 XML and patterns) seems to persist as rather low when compared with the other 
categories.

5.6   Trend in the Use of the “Groupware” Term 

As mentioned in the Introduction, the initial goal of the Conference was to ease collaboration 
of researchers  working in the Groupware field. We have now  the  feeling 
that groupware is being phased out in favor of other terms, including “collaborative 
technology”,  “group support”, or more specific  keywords. Figure 19 shows that the 
percentage of occurrences of the keyword in the proceedings of each year is declining,
 thus supporting our hypothesis.  

The percentages were calculated using Word Counter 2.10 to scan PDF files, count 
words and convert PDF to text; and then using TextEdit to count how many times the 
groupware keyword appears in the text. To avoid counting occurrences in the papers’ 
references sections, we manually removed them from the PDF files.

The entries are by no means definitive truths, but rather the authors’ interpretations of the 
data elements presented above; they are subject to contrast with other viewpoints.

7   Conclusions 

Several conclusions are already embedded in the SWAT analysis. However, the authors 
would like to emphasize a few of them.  

The  CRIWG  conference  is  a  well-established  conference  with  a  positive  SWAT 
chart. Of course, weaknesses should be faced and maybe they can be corrected. Although 
the average number of cites received is higher than the average LNCS conference,
 it certainly would be desirable to raise that figure.  

Table 13. SWAT analysis of CRIWG 

Strengths 
 
- Average citation index within range of other 

reputed conferences and above LNCS  
average. 

Weaknesses 
 
- Lack of cohesive research topics and trends. 
- Small focus in communities of practice 

(although it is increasing). 

- More than 18% papers were extended and 

- Small number of references to CRIWG 

republished in ISI journals.  
- Variety of evaluation methods. 
- Significant focus on prototyping  
development and design issues. 
- Balance between positivistic and  

interpretivist evaluation methods. 

papers. 

- Dependence on ACM conferences. 
- About half of the papers do not have any 

impact.  

- Small overall h-index. 
- About half of the papers do not address 

- High number of collaborations (currently at 

evaluation. 

57%). 

- Long-term agreement to publish proceedings 

in LNCS series. 

- ISI visibility. 
 
Opportunities 
 
- The largest number of papers comes from 
Brazil. This country also has a strong local 
conference on CSCW. A possible synergy? 
- Emergent application areas outside the core 
of the conference could be used to attract 
interesting papers.  
- Some journals already know the conference 
and accept special issues; it could be possible 
to associate the conference to a specific  
prestigious journal.  
 

Threats 
 
- Dependence on a small set of authors. 
- Great challenges in the field already worked 
out (e.g., awareness). 
- A relatively small number of accepted 
papers may not make economically viable to 
organize the conference in the future.  

Perhaps  the  opportunities  can  be  taken.  The  authors  particularly  suggest  the 
CRIWG Steering Committee  should discuss  with the Brazilian  members the advantages 
and disadvantages of organizing the conference more often in Brazil. For example,
 the CRIWG conference could eventually merge  with the Brazilian CSCW local 
event; the conference could be held in Brazil and abroad in alternating years. This is 
especially relevant since the 2011 conference will be held in Brazil.  

 

A Review of CRIWG Research

Another suggestion to the CRIWG conference would be to explore possibilities of 
long-term association with prestigious journals in the area. Finally, the incorporation 
of new promising research fields in areas of interest of the conference could also be 
considered.
