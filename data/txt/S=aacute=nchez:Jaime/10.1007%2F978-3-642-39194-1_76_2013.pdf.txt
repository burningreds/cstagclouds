Abstract. The purpose of this study was to design, develop and evaluate audiobased 
software to assist people who are blind in public bus transportation. The 
audio-based software for mobile devices Audiotransantiago was designed in order 
to provide information regarding authorized bus stops for the entire bus service 
in the city of Santiago de Chile (known as Transantiago). The study was 
designed to allow users who are blind to build up a mental map that is adjusted 
to their surroundings while traveling on the bus system. It  was  found that the 
use of the software improved information processing skills, tempo-spatial orientation 
and orientation and mobility skills (O&M), as users were able to navigate 
from  one  place  to  another  without  having  to  obtain  information  prior  to  their 
trip. 

Keywords: People with visual disabilities, Audio-based interfaces, Orientation 
and Mobility, environmental perception and cognition.

Introduction 

The varied and complex scenarios present in large cities have generated the need to 
implement  urban  policies  designed  to  modernize  transportation  services,  in  order  to 
facilitate movement between different areas within the city and seeking to eliminate 
the barriers that make traveling throughout the city more difficult [2]. As people who 
are blind lack a visual channel, they must orient themselves by recognizing their surroundings 
and establishing their position within their environment by using perceived 
information acquired through touch and hearing as a strategy [1][6]. In this way, visually 
disabled people obtain information from the environment and use it to be able 
to travel effectively and safely when navigating through the city [11], compensating 
for their lack of vision by obtaining information through other channels of perception 
as a source of knowledge for learning [1][9].  

In taking the need to generate easy access for the use of public transportation by 
the disabled and elderly population into account [2], research has been carried out in 
many countries regarding the experiences of such users when using public transportation.
 Such research has been used in order to implement measures that favor the integration 
 of  these  people  into  the  system.  Some  examples  are:  Brazil  (RIT:  Red

Integrada de Transporte, BRT: Bus Rapid Transit) [3][15][16], Colombia (Transmile-
nio) [7][15], Venezuela (Transbarca) [12], Spain (TMB: Transport Metropolitans de 
Barcelona)  [13],  China  (PTO:  public  transit  oriented)  [17],  and  Taiwan  [18][19]. 
Based on this research, several state plans have been implemented that seek to facilitate 
the use of surface transportation by disabled or elderly people. These experiences 
have coincided in the need to generate a higher level of respect towards this population 
without distinction, guaranteeing their access to autonomous mobility through the 
city. One important aspect highlighted by these studies is the inclusion of an operational 
design that includes elements of accessibility capable of providing solutions to 
a number of needs,  such as:  spaces  within buses  for  wheelchairs, tactile  guides and 
signs, ramps, elevators, proper lighting, audio informational services, etc. These elements 
would provide general comfort and safety for the transportation of disabled and 
elderly populations.  

In the city of Santiago de Chile it has been sought to implement policies and regulations 
regarding access to public transportation by people with disabilities [4], having 
established “Regulations on equality and the social inclusion of handicapped people” 
so that these individuals are able to utilize public transportation safely and independently.
 These regulations incorporate the concept of “easy access”, accounting for and 
attending  to  the  capabilities  and  the  nature  of  each  different  mode  of  transportation 
based on its location and geography. In this way, changes in patterns of urbanization 
and the integration of the visually disabled into a variety of activities within society 
geared towards autonomous navigation with equal conditions among a wide variety of 
urban sectors and spaces, represents a special challenge and need for the population 
[5][8]. 

The  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  design,  develop  and  evaluate  audio-based  software 
to assist in public bus transportation for people who are blind. It is in this context 
that the Audiotransantiago [10] software has been developed. Audiotransantiago 
is an audio-based software program for mobile PocketPC devices. The purpose of the 
software is to provide information regarding authorized bus stops for the entire bus 
service in the city of Santiago de Chile (known as Transantiago), in addition  to the 
streets around each stop and places of interest near to the scheduled routes. The idea 
is for the software to allow users who are blind to build up a mental map that is adjusted 
 to  their  surroundings  while  traveling  on  the  bus  system.  A  synthetic  voice, 
together with the commands available through the buttons on the PocketPC, allow a 
person who is blind to plan several different routes in an urban environment by establishing 
a point of departure and a destination point within the software.

Audiotransantiago Software 

Regarding  the  interaction,  the  Audiotransantiago  software  provides  sound-based  information 
 based  on  circular  menus,  with  color  contrast  and  the  use  of  both  synthesized 
voice and non-verbal audio cues. It makes use of a Text-To-Speech engine and 
an audio-based interface through  which it conveys information to the user, complemented 
 by  non-verbal  sounds  that  help  to  identify  the  navigational  flow  within  the 

 

Audio Transportation System for Blind People 

663 

application  menus.  The  software  also  utilizes  a  minimalist  graphic  interface,  which 
includes only the name of the selection that is being used and the option that has been 
selected, using a strong color contrast that can be useful for those users with residual 
vision  who  can  only  distinguish  shapes  when  displayed  with  highly  contrasting  
colors. 

To navigate between the various software functions, the user must utilize the buttons 
located on the inner part of the PocketPC (PPC), which allows the user to access 
the  different  functionalities  of  the  software  application.  The  software  includes  two 
main modes of interaction: (1) “Travel Planning”, in which the user is able to plan a 
trip by using the various functions of the PPC keypad to select an area to navigate, the 
kind  of  transportation  service  to  be  used  (bus),  and  then  defining  the  direction  in 
which  the  trip  will  be  taken,  establishing  an  initial  bus  stop  and  a  final  destination. 
Afterwards,  the  programmed  trip  remains  stored  in  the  “Execute  Travel”  option,  in 
which the user is finally able to select the previously planned trip. The advantage of 
this option is that it allows the user to save multiple trips without having to reprogram 
the same trip every time it is taken. In selecting a pre-programmed trip, the user utilizes 
the PPC to anticipate the bus stops included on the planned route, and also has 
the option of requesting contextual information regarding streets and places of interest 
around  each  stop.  This  aids  the  user  in  creating  a  mental  map  of  the  environment 
through audio-based information, and in making decisions when faced with problems, 
which also implies reprogramming the initially planned route in real time. In this way, 
the user has a high degree of autonomy in navigating through different areas of the 
city by using the bus system, in order to arrive at his final destination.  

In  making  comparisons,  there  are  cities  that  provide  interactive  transportation 
guides for people. PoaTransporte [20] is an on-line system that allows users to access 
surface public transportation lines based on the direction of travel. Using the interactive 
map generated by the system, the user can also locate bus stops and taxi service 
locations.  The  user  is  also  able  to  ask  questions  based  on  the  specification  of  the 
names of each bus line. Despite the fact that PoaTransporte represents an efficient and 
practical information service, it does not possess the characteristics of digital accessibility 
that would make it beneficial for use by people with visual disability.  

In  allowing  users  with  visual  disability  to  be  able  to  access  information  in  a  dynamic 
 fashion,  by  constructing  and  generating  questions  regarding  different  routes, 
Audiotransantiago  provides  for  a  perception  of  the  environment,  mainly  regarding 
collective public spaces. In this way, it seeks to appropriate space in the way that the 
user  generates  a  symbolic  identification  with  his  surroundings,  allowing  the  user  to 
perform actions and change his plans during the bus ride. This implies a high degree 
of interaction with the environment and a mental (re)construction of the surrounding 
areas, providing for personal meaning in the user’s interaction with the urban area.

Cognitive Evaluation 

The experiment performed to evaluate Audiotransantiago was designed to determine 
whether an audio-based system favored autonomous navigation by people with visual 
disability on surface public transportation (buses).

Sample  

The sample was made up of 14 individuals, including 10 men and 4 women, of whom 
3 were totally blind and 11 had low-level vision. The sample selection was performed 
by using a non-probabilistic quota sampling method based on the following criteria: 
(a) being between 14 and 55 years old, (b) being blind or having low-level vision, (c) 
being registered in the National Registry of Disability, and (d) having previously been 
trained in orientation and mobility techniques. The sample was divided into 2 groups, 
one control group (CG) (Table 1) and one experimental (EG) (Table 2).

The EG navigated the routes by using information provided by the software regarding 
which bus line to take, the initial bus stop, official bus stops between the point of 
departure and destination point, streets around the stops, and streets around the destination 
point. The users in the CG performed the same routes, by using only information 
 regarding  the  point  of  departure  and  destination  of  the  route.  This  latter  group 
navigated the routes by using the navigational strategies that they utilize very effectively 
on a daily basis when using this mode of transportation.

3.2  Tasks 

Three  routes  were  developed  between  different  geographic  points  in  the  city.  The 
varying  levels  of  difficulty  were  based  on  the  number  of  stops  and  the  distance 
(measured  in  meters)  between  the  point  of  departure  and  the  destination  point.  In 
order to provide for a higher degree of flexibility and to offer alternatives for navigation 
 to  the  blind  users,  each  route  was  designed  in  such  a  way  that  there  are  two

665 

possible bus routes to arrive at the destination. In addition, a third route incorporated 
changing from one bus to another in order to continue on the desired route. 

3.3 

Instruments 

The evaluation of the tasks (routes) was carried out through the use of two different 
instruments: a “Route Evaluation Guideline” and a “Self-Performance Evaluation”. 

The Route evaluation guideline was used to collect information regarding the mobility,
 orientation and travel skills utilized on each of the scheduled routes. The guidelines 
were structured around the following dimensions: (a) Time, (b) Autonomy, (c) 
Spatial Orientation, (d) Navigational Efficacy, and (e) Problem Solving. In order to 
evaluate the items included in the guideline a 4-point scale was utilized, ranging from 
“always” to “never”. 

After having applied the Route Evaluation Guideline, which was carried out by a 
teacher-facilitator through direct observation, the “Self-Performance Evaluation” was 
administered  to  each  user  once  the  bus  route  had  been  successfully  navigated.  This 
instrument was designed to collect information on the effects of the user’s experience 
during the bus rides, and the orientation and mobility strategies that had been used in 
order to face and solve the challenges that the users confronted. In the case of the EG, 
the  application  of  this  guideline  allowed  for  the  collection  of  information  regarding 
the evaluation that the users themselves made of the software’s effectiveness for aiding 
in autonomous and efficient navigation through the city by bus.  

This latter instrument consisted of 9 questions, applied to each user once the route 
had been completed: “What did you think of the assigned route?”, “Were you familiar 
with the starting and ending points of the route beforehand?”, “Was this route familiar 
to  you?”,  “What  strategies  did  you  use  to  take  the  trip?”, “Did  you  experience  any 
problematic situations during the trip? If so, what were they? What solution did you 
come up with for these difficulties?”, “Were you able to anticipate situations or difficulties 
while you were taking the bus route?”, “What information is useful in order to 
orient yourself and take a trip on the bus?”, What kind of technologies would you use 
in order to help make better use of the transportation system? Why?”, “On a scale of 1 
to 7, how would you evaluate your performance?”.  

These questions point to issues related to concepts of perception and environmental 
cognition  [21],  regarding  the  way  in  which  information  on  different  places  is  organized,
 stored and remembered, including distances, the position of objects and spaces 
[22].  In  this  way,  the  instrument  allows  researchers  to  verify  the  users’  arguments 
regarding how and what he learned during the interaction with Audiotransantiago. 

3.4 

Procedure 

Initially, a facilitator provided the user with information on the route that was to be 
taken,  informing  the  user  of  the  starting  point  and  the  destination.  Afterwards,  the 
facilitator asked the user to interact with the buttons on the PPC, and by following the 
audio information through the use of headphones, to configure the “Travel Planning” 
mode by defining the bus to take, the starting bus stop, the direction of the trip, and 
the destination bus stop. This creates the trip file needed to initiate a bus travel route.

The second step consisted of recovering the trip file from the “Execute Trip” mode 
through the buttons on the PPC. After doing this and using the headphones in order to 
obtain the information, the user positioned himself at the bus stop, guided by the tactile 
patterns on the ground, in order to wait for the bus. Once the bus arrived, the user 
got on, aided by the facilitator, as the system does not provide information on the bus 
route prior to its stopping at the starting point.  

Finally, the user entered the bus, executing navigational actions within the Audiotransantiago 
 system  through  the  buttons  on  the  PPC,  anticipating  the  bus  stops  that 
occur throughout the entire route. To complement their travel, many users consulted 
the system regarding streets or places of interest near the various bus stops. This was 
done in order to establish a mental map of the route navigated and to facilitate in the 
learning of information needed to reach their final destination (Figure 1). In this way, 
the  users  were able to better  understand, structure, and learn about the environment 
through which they traveled.  

During  each  route,  the  users  were  accompanied  by  a  facilitator  who  supported 
them  during  any  situations  throughout  the  trip  that  they  could  not  resolve,  such  as 
getting off the bus in the case that the bus was defective in this regard, setting another 
route  in  the  case  of  excessive  traffic,  among  other  situations.  In  the  same  way,  the 
facilitator  collected  information  on  the  user’s  experience  through  direct  evaluation, 
utilizing  the  Route  Evaluation  Guideline,  and  applied  the  Self-Performance  Evaluation 
at the end of the route.  

The implementation and development of the various activities lasted approximately 
6 months, and was subject to the time availability of the participants. In this way, in 
several cases there were prolonged intermittent periods between the different stages of 
the experiment.

Results 

All of the participants in both groups (CG and EG) were able to plan and execute the 
proposed routes using the Audiotransantiago software. However, in order to reach the 
destination the participants experienced difficulties that were unrelated to the use of 
the software, and were instead related to the bus transportation system itself. In this

667 

way, the evaluation was centered mainly on judging whether or not the user’s interaction 
with the software favored autonomy, efficiency in travel, and the necessary prob-
lem-solving  skills  for  selecting  and  managing  the  information  needed  to  plan  and 
execute a trip autonomously using the bus system in the city. 

The results show the percentage of achievement for each route carried out by the 
users from each group, determined through the Route Evaluation Guideline. The EG 
obtained  an  average  achievement  rate  of  81.7%,  while  the  CG  obtained  an  average 
rate of 71.8% (Table 3). These results show that the use of Audiotransantiago facilitates 
navigation through the city by bus for users with visual disabilities.

In the execution of the routes, the CG displayed lower execution results for all of 
the routes taken compared to the EG. Route 3 represented the highest level of complexity,
 and similar levels of performance were achieved between both groups. This is 
mainly due to the need to correctly reprogram the route by both groups, as all users 
were aided in this case by the help of the facilitators in order to continue with their 
trip. A T-test comparing the means between two independent samples was performed 
in order to compare the statistical relevance of the difference between the  means of 
the CG and EG for each route. This test determined that the differences were not statistically 
significant.  

Finally, although the results obtained were not statistically significant, the performance 
levels achieved for the 3 routes taken both by the Control Group and the Experimental 
Group represent an initial precedent in order to establish actions based on the 
use of audio-based technological tools that facilitate autonomous navigation by blind 
people through different areas of the city. Accordingly, obstacles can be at least partially 
eliminated, such as the need to depend on other people in order to move about 
and to actively utilize the public bus transportation system. In this way, Audiotransantiago 
has been determined to be an effective and useful tool for acquiring knowledge 
regarding the surroundings that the user has navigated, and at the same time providing 
necessary tools so that blind people themselves can make decisions regarding alternative 
routes towards different places in order to meet their travel needs.

Conclusions 

The purpose of this study was to design, develop and evaluate audio-based software 
to assist in public bus transportation for people who are blind. As a result, Audiotransantiago 
allowed users to have access to and manage information on buses and their 
routes through a variety of urban areas, understand how the bus system works, learn 
the cost of tickets and, in many cases, to orient users in their spatial configuration of 
the  areas  within  the  bus  (seats,  sounds,  doors).  The  use  of  the  software  improved  

668 

J. Sánchez and M. de Borba Campos 

information  processing  skills,  tempo-spatial  orientation  and  O&M  skills,  as  users 
were able to navigate from one place to another without having to obtain information 
prior to their trip.  

The main focus of this research was centered on evaluating whether or not an au-
dio-based, technological tool favored autonomous navigation by people who are blind 
on  surface  bus  transportation  in  order  to  travel  between  different  points  throughout 
the  city.  In  this  way,  it  is  possible  to  conclude  that  the  Audiotransantiago  software 
provides information based on the bus service, its routes, bus stops, and streets around 
the various stops, including places that could be considered to be of cultural, social, 
economic or educational interest.  

The results obtained allowed the researchers to conclude that the use of a mobile 
device  makes  putting  navigational  strategies  into  practice  possible,  supported  by  a 
system  of  contextual  information  in  order  for  the  user  to  be  able  to  orient  himself 
within the bus system, based on knowledge of bus stops, nearby streets and places of 
interest.  As  such,  afterwards  these  places  can  be  visited  as  many  times  as  the  user 
plans, in that the use of the software aids in the creation of a mental map of the environment 
through which the user travels, in addition to incorporating information that 
is  able  to  take  the  surrounding  environment  into  account,  thus  widening  the  user’s 
overall knowledge of the city.  

Audiotransantiago, as a sound feedback-based technological proposal, provides users 
who are blind with information that allows them to utilize surface, urban transportation 
 independently.  The  proposed  software  supports  these  users’  orientation  and 
mobility skills, providing information on the physical surroundings with an emphasis 
on contextual information regarding bus stops, route change stations, as well as nearby 
 places  of  interest  surrounding  the  routes  such  as  museums,  public  services,  and 
others. Audiotransantiago can be seen as a tool that facilitates the inclusion of people 
with visual disabilities in interactions with the urban environment, as it allows for the 
development of strategies that seek improved cognition and environmental perception 
based on a direct experience with the surrounding environment at any given time. In 
this way, the recognition of spatial considerations is not the result of a passive process 
of  receiving  information,  because  it  involves  the  interpretation  and  restructuring  of 
information and actions by the visually impaired user.  

Despite showing the effectiveness of using the Audiotransantiago software as a relevant 
tool for providing useful information for decision-making and problem solving, 
the public bus transportation system currently presents serious defects and complexities 
that emerge as variables that the software cannot control. This is the case regarding 
the frequency and circulation of the buses, the buses not stopping at each of the 
designated bus stops, and a lack of information on route changes or detours that can 
occur for various reasons. All of this is in addition to the high congestion during peak 
travel  times,  and  the  scarcity  of  Braille  or  audio-based  traffic  lights  or  information 
signs as integrated in the original design of the system, as well as the constant change 
of bus routes and the specific directions that they take. Often the general public, with 
or without visual impairment, is not informed of such changes in a timely manner, so 
that adequate planning measures can be taken to compensate for the diversions from 
normality.
