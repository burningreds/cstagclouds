accuracy in the model by means of the error-propagation theory. The empirical
component seeks to model what is known as information loss, i.e. the sum of the
error due purely to sampling the continuous terrain surface with a finite grid
interval and the interpolation error. For this purpose, randomly spaced data
points, supposed to be free of error, were converted into regularly gridded data
points using triangulation with linear interpolation. Original sample data were
collected with a 262 m sampling interval from eight different morphologies,
from flat terrain to highly rugged terrain, applying digital photogrammetric
methods to large-scale aerial stereo imagery (1 : 5000). The DEM root mean
square error was calculated by the true validation method over several sets of
check points, obtaining the different sampling densities tested in this work.
Several empirical models are calibrated and validated with the experimental data
set by modelling the DEM accuracy by combining two variables such as sampling
density and a descriptive attribute of terrain morphology. These empirical models
presented a morphology based on the product of two potential functions, one
related to the terrain roughness and another related to the sampling density. The
terrain descriptors tested were average terrain slope, standard deviation of terrain
slope, standard deviation of unitary vectors perpendicular to the topographic
surface (SDUV), standard deviation of the difference in height between adjacent
samples in the grid DEM (SDHD), and roughness estimation by first-, second-,
or third-degree surface fitting error. The values obtained for those terrain
descriptors were reasonably independent from the number and spatial distribution 
of the sample data. The models based on descriptors SDHD, SDUV, and
standard deviation of slope provided a good fitting to the data observed
(R2.0.94) in the calibration phase, model SDHD being the one that yielded the
best results in validation. Therefore, it would be possible to establish a priori the
optimum grid size required to generate or store a DEM of a particular accuracy,
with the saving in computing time and file size that this would mean for the
digital flow of the mapping information in GIS.

Introduction

Digital elevation models (DEMs) have become one of the most important covers for
Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in many disciplines, which highlight the
need to assess DEM accuracy. If GIS users are not aware of the DEM accuracy,
perfectly logical GIS analysis techniques can lead to incorrect results. In other
words, the data may not be fit for use in a certain context (Fisher 1998).

The awareness of the GIS user community of this problem is shown by the vast
number of studies published in the last few years on error detection, both
quantitative methods based on statistical-mathematical algorithms (e.g. Felicı´simo
1994, Lo´ pez 1997, Briese et al. 2002) and qualitative methods based on visualization
techniques (Wood and Fisher 1993, Wood 1996, Yang and Hodler 2000).

It must be borne in mind that the DEM data-acquisition phase has reached a
remarkable degree of development with the introduction of new technologies, such as
the laser scanner (LIDAR) and InSAR (Smith 2004), which allow a high degree of
automation and density sensing. Thus, the US Geological Survey scientists are now
finding new methods for the use and representation of high-resolution LIDAR data
(Queija et al. 2005). Therefore, the problem nowadays is not obtaining data from a
DEM, but handling and maintaining such an amount of information using structures,
which will allow its efficient integration and exploitation in GIS or CAD areas. In the
majority of cases, it is preferable to have an optimized DEM adapted to our needs, i.e.
without excess information, rather than to have a vast amount of data, which will be
more difficult for us to handle (Aguilar et al. 2005). Thus, optimum sampling strategies
are clear favourites to guarantee the quality requirements of a DEM with the lowest
possible number of points (Balce 1987).

It seems obvious that the user and the producer of DEMs need to agree on the
accuracy and the grid interval of the product, among other specifications (Huang
2000). To this end, they should speak the same language and have models at their
disposal that will allow them to predict the grid DEM accuracy in terms of the main
factors that intervene in its definition: accuracy and density of the data source,
characteristics of the terrain surface and the method used for the construction of the
DEM surface (Li 1992, Gong et al. 2000). The work presented in this paper is
focused on this last point.

Most of the models developed in the last few years for modelling the global error
of a DEM can be classified as empirical or theoretical. Within the empirical models,
based on experience, the works of Ackermann (1980), Ayeni (1982), Li (1992), Gao
(1997) and Davis et al. (2001) can be referred to. In these empirical models
regression techniques are used to adjust the different parameters of the model to the
experimental results obtained, generally on vast terrain databases. As an example of
a classical methodology in the development of this type of model, we can highlight
Gao’s work (1997), where the accuracy (root mean square error (RMSE)) of the
DEMs extracted from topographic maps was regressed against contour density
(km km22) and DEM resolution at six resolution levels. More recent studies like that
of Davis et al.
the Digital
for modelling the accuracy of grid
Photogrammetric Workstations (DPWs)
DEMs. It is an interesting empirical model capable of estimating both the global
error of the DEM (RMSE) and the vertical accuracy of the elevation value for every
grid point in the DEM (spatial variation of elevation error). For this purpose, they
use parameters derived from the automated DEM extraction, called figure of merit
(FOM), as independent variables in the regression analysis. An FOM value is

produced for each DEM point by the stereo-correlation software used in the DEM
generation process. Obviously, this model is highly dependent upon the methods
used for computing FOM values and would only be suitable when the stereomatching 
method is being utilized to obtain the DEM.

In the case of theoretical models, the first relevant contributions were based on
the Fourier analysis
relatively complex mathematical
(Kubik and
(Makarovic 1972) and autocovariance and variogram analysis
Botman 1976). In the first case, no suitable mathematical expressions were derived
for practical application, whilst in the second, it should be stressed that it is difficult
to have good approximate co-variance values as a terrain descriptor, and therefore
the final prediction would not be very reliable (Li 1993a).

formulations

such as

Since the 1990s, it has been possible to observe a certain tendency to develop
theoretical models based on the error-propagation theory, segmenting the problem
and calculating separately the error contributed by the different uncertainty sources.
In the case of Weng’s proposal (2002), the total DEM uncertainty is determined
from cartographic digitising, as the square root of the sum of the RMSE squares
related to three sources of error:
sampling and
measurement error, and interpolation process. Likewise, Filin and Doytsher’s work
(1998) can be quoted, where a thorough and mathematically complex theoretical
model is developed based on the propagation error of the photogrammetric solution
process.

topographic map source,

A special mention is made of the studies carried out by Li (1993a, b), as they have
provided the basis for the theoretical development of the model presented in this
paper. In these studies, theoretical models are based on the distinction between the
error ascribable to measuring the sample data points, which from now on will be
referred to as s2
SDE or sample data error, and the sum of the interpolation error and
the error due purely to sampling the continuous terrain surface with a finite grid
interval (s2
IL). The latter is sometimes referred to as information loss (Huang 2000).
It is important to note that both terms are expressed as error variance.

Of the two terms mentioned, s2

SDE is relatively easy to obtain from empirical
observations. For example, in photogrammetric DEM generation, the photographic
scale is the main determinant of DEM accuracy given that all other specifications
are logically consistent. In this case, s2
SDE can be estimated with reasonable
approximation from the Flying Height above Mean Terrain (H). Torlegard et al.
(1986) evaluating the sampling error as 0.2–0.4% (per mill) of the flight height H for
flat terrain and 1–2% H for mountainous terrain. In the case of DEM generation
using DPWs, a high precision of sSDE,0.1% H can be achieved for manual
measurement (Karras et al. 1998). For elevations collected automatically with a
cursor kept on the terrain by digital correlation, the precision obtained could be
sSDE,0.2% H (Karras et al. 1998). The typical specification for vertical error is a
sSDE of H/9000 and a maximum error of three times sSDE (Daniel and Tennant
2001).

Likewise,

theoretical approximations based on space resection projective
geometry can be used, obtaining equations like the following (Saleh and Scarpace
2000):

focal length (mm), sp the parallax precision (pixels) and H/B the base-to-distance
ratio of the photogrammetric flight. Values of sp between 0.4 and 0.7 pixels are
frequent in DPW automatic DEM generation (Karras et al. 1998).

Nonetheless, the estimation of sIL presents greater problems because terrain
shape varies from place to place, i.e. ‘terrain is highly capricious’. Therefore, it is
impossible to find an analytical method to compute the standard deviation for all
the height differences (dh) between the terrain surface and the DEM surface (sIL). Li
(1993b) proposes the use of statistical methods where the random variable is dh.
However, the model proposed by Li (1993b) requires the estimation of a series of
parameters which depend to a great extent on the morphology of the terrain, a
circumstance which is not resolved in the above-mentioned study.

One alternative to theoretical or empirical models for modelling information loss
could be that pointed out in Huang’s (2000) paper. This study proposes the
utilization of the possibilities offered by powerful DPWs to generate an extremely
dense set of points derived directly from stereo-correlation. This DEM can be as
dense as one point every few pixels. Therefore, the DEM can be treated as a
representation of the terrain free from information loss, i.e. it could be considered as
a very good reference surface for assessing the information loss in a less dense DEM.
This is a practical, simple, and interesting methodology that can only be applied if
we have a DPW. Moreover, to estimate the accuracy of a grid DEM with a certain
spacing, it would be necessary to obtain previously an extremely dense DEM of the
same terrain.

In this paper,

the estimation of sIL was approached by an empirical
approximation, where the most important factors that intervene in the vertical
accuracy of a grid DEM are taken into account, such as sampling interval and
terrain complexity (Li 1992, Gong et al. 2000, Aguilar et al. 2005). Previously, the
modelling method was fixed as triangulation with linear interpolation, and the error
variance of the data source (s2

SDE) was included in the theoretical model.

2. Methodology

2.1 Study sites and data sets

The two study areas are located in Almerı´a, south-eastern Spain. The first is situated
in what is known as the ‘Comarca del Ma´ rmol’, specifically in the municipal area of
Macael. It is a zone with marble quarries and a high level of extraction activity
which has formed a terraced and artificial relief; hence the predominance of steep
slopes and even vertical walls that are found there. The second study area is situated
in the ‘Comarca del Campo de Nı´jar’, bordering on the ‘Cabo de Gata’ Nature
Reserve. This is an area with a smooth relief sculpted by natural agents. For the
development of this study, eight topographic surfaces were selected, measuring
1986198 m (approximately 3.92 ha), two situated in Macael, and six in Nı´jar. The
morphological characteristics of these surfaces can be observed in table 1. It is
interesting to observe the great diversity of the morphologies utilized, in terms of
their roughness and their average slope. As a roughness descriptor, we used the
Standard Deviation of Unitary Vectors perpendicular to the topographic surface
(SDUV), calculated as detailed in section 2.4.

The DEM of each topographic surface was obtained automatically by stereoimage 
matching. Later on, a revision and a manual edition of the DEM were carried
out. The photogrammetric flight presented an approximate scale of 1 : 5000 and was

carried out with a Zeiss RMK TOP 15 metric camera using a wide-angle lens with a
focal
length of 153.33 mm. The negatives were digitalized with a Vexcel 5000
photogrammetric scanner with a geometric resolution of 20 mm and a radiometric
resolution of 24 bits (8 bits per RGB channel). In the case of the Nı´jar study area,
the DEM was constructed using the module Automatic Terrain Extraction of the
digital photogrammetric system LH Systems SOCET SET NT 4.3.1H. For the study
area of Macael, the DEM was constructed using the modules ImageStation
Automatic Elevations and ImageStation DTM Collection of the digital photogrammetric 
system Z/I Imaging ImageStation SSKH. In both cases, we obtained a final
DEM in grid format with a spacing of 262 m, orthometric elevations, map
projection UTM zone 30 North and European Datum 1950.

2.2 Theoretical approach

The theoretical development presented is similar to that proposed by Li (1993b) and
used by other authors like Huang (2000). In Li’s paper (1993b), the error made when
modelling the terrain surface is determined using contiguous bilinear facets
supported by square grid sample data. In our case, randomly spaced data points
are converted into regularly gridded data points using triangulation with linear
interpolation, i.e. we use contiguous triangular facets to obtain regular grid DEMs.
In figure 1, a facet can be observed from the triangular grid established with the use
of the optimal Delaunay triangulation (Guibas and Stolfi 1985). This algorithm
creates triangles by drawing lines between data points. The original points are
connected in such a way that no triangle edges are intersected by other triangles. The
result is a patchwork of triangular facets over the extension of the grid.

The overall average value of error variances for all the points along the whole AB

Where s2
SDE is the sample data error, expressed as error variance. The introduction
of the sample data error into the theoretical model is crucial, since the results
obtained by Filin and Doytsher (1998) have shown that ignoring the accuracy
estimate of the measurements can lead to biased results. However, for the overall
accuracy of any point K belonging to the AB profile, another term should be added:

IL being the information loss, i.e. the error due purely to sampling with a finite
grid interval and using linear interpolation for modelling terrain surface (Huang
2000). The derivation of equation (3) is based on the general error-propagation
theory (expressed as error variance), assuming that the sources of error (sample data
error and information loss) are independent or uncorrelated and, besides, that the
errors are randomly distributed (Li 1993b, Huang 2000, Weng 2002).

The calculation of the overall accuracy of height Z at point T (ZT) can come close to
determining the error made when linearly interpolating profile KC, C being the third
sample point of the triangle. From figure 1, the following expression can be deduced:

2.3 Evaluation of the grid DEM accuracy

As we discussed in the previous section, we only need to estimate the value of sIL to
evaluate the grid DEM error, ssurf, because sSDE can be obtained from empirical
observations depending on the method used to measure the sample data points. If the
sample data points are considered free of error, the following expression is deduced:

Because the most widely used global accuracy measure for evaluating the performance
of DEMs is the RMSE (Li 1988, Wood 1996, Yang and Hodler 2000), and bearing in
mind that the RMSE is close to the value of ssurf when the mean of residuals tends to be
zero (unbiased residuals), we can write the following equation:

RMSEsurf

That is to say, estimating RMSEsurf when the sample data points are considered free of
error (sSDE50), we obtain an indirect measure of the value of the information loss
(RMSEIL<sIL).

In figure 2, we can observe the flow chart of the procedure employed for computing
RMSEsurf using the true validation method (Voltz and Webster 1990), always
considering the check points as free of error. We notice that the residuals at the M
check points (randomly sampled) can be spatially autocorrelated. This property of the
DEM error has been reported by several authors (Wood 1996, Fisher 1998, Weng
2002). In fact, if the residuals at the check points are not independent, we could state
that the true sample size is lower than that of the M check points. Therefore, the use of
a data set of M spatially autocorrelated residuals would lead to an RMSEsurf
variability which is lower than it should be. Thus, we checked the degree of spatial
autocorrelation for every residual data set with a semivariogram (Aguilar et al. 2005).
As a general rule, we found a typical transitional semivariogram with range, nugget,
and sill that were fitted to a spherical model. The lower range computed was around
20 m. Therefore, if the distance separating two check points is greater than the range,
then the residuals measured at those check points are not spatially autocorrelated. For
this reason, a pseudo-random algorithm was designed for the extraction of check
points, imposing the condition that the separation between the points extracted should
be at least 20 m. A final value of 73 check points was obtained for each control data set,
corresponding to the minimum value computed for the eight data sets.

The different sampling densities tested were obtained from the original DEM of each
morphology by stratified random sampling (464 sampling quadrants). In table 2, we
can see the nine sample densities contemplated (N1 to N9) and their equivalent spacing
in a regular grid. For each sample density, four repetitions were extracted, showing a
total of 469536 initial data sets for each morphology tested (figure 2).

Once the initial data sets were obtained, a 262 m spacing grid DEM was
generated for each data set using triangulation with the linear interpolation method.
The residuals of each DEM were assessed over the 73 check points previously
selected in each morphology, obtaining the vertical RMSE (RMSEsurf estimated) as
observed variable, calculated according to equation (11):

2.4 Definition and processing of terrain roughness descriptors

As variables that are representative of the topographic surface morphology,
the following descriptors were selected: average terrain slope (AS), standard
deviation of terrain slope (SDS), standard deviation of unitary vectors perpendicular 
to the topographic surface (SDUV), standard deviation of
the height
difference between adjacent samples in the DEM (SDHD), and finally the
roughness estimation by first, second, and third degree surface fitting error
(SFE1, SFE2, and SFE3). The processing and detailed calculation of each one of
these are described below.

First, we proceeded to fill in the grid using triangulation with linear interpolation
from the original sample points (N1 to N9 sampling densities). The appropriate
triangulated irregular network was obtained by the optimal algorithm Delaunay
triangulation (Guibas and Stolfi 1985). A final grid DEM with a spacing of 262 m
was obtained for each original data set, to be considered as input for computing the
descriptors AS, SDS, SDUV, and SDHD. The calculation of descriptors SFE1,
SFE2, and SFE3 was carried out over the original sample data,
i.e. without
interpolation.

2.4.1 Average Terrain Slope (AS). Starting from the 262 m spacing grid DEM,
the slope (Sij) was determined in each node of the grid using the gradient calculation:

The third-order finite difference method shown in equation (12) is more accurate
than some of the others (Skidmore 1989) and was therefore chosen for this study.
Using the compass-based grid notation difference, equation (12) yields:

where ZE, ZW, ZN, and ZS are the elevations of the four cardinal points (east, west,

The value of the average terrain slope descriptor would be the arithmetical mean
of the slopes calculated in every node in the grid, excluding the edge values (first and
last rows, first and last columns).

2.4.2 Standard deviation of
terrain slope (SDS). The standard terrain slope
deviation was computed in radians from the slope values on each node of the
grid DEM obtained in the previous section:

2.4.3 Standard deviation of unitary vectors perpendicular to the topographic surface
(SDUV). Once the slope had been determined at each point in the grid DEM, its
aspect was calculated. The algorithm for computing terrain aspect calculates the
downhill direction of the steepest slope at each grid node. The aspect at each grid
node was calculated as angle hij, expressed in degrees, which exists between direction
north and the projection on the horizontal plane of the slope vector normal to the
surface. That is to say, 0u points to the north and 90u points to the east:

The SDUV was computed determining the variance of the unitary vectors which are
perpendicular to the surface in each node (i,j) in the grid DEM (adapted from
Hobson 1972). The Cartesian components xi,j, yi,j, and zi,j of each unitary vector can
be expressed in terms of slope Sij and aspect hij in this node through the following
expressions:

xij~ sin (cij) sin (hij)

yij~ sin (cij) cos (hij)

This way, we were able to find the variance of the unitary vectors for each coordinate

2.4.4 Standard deviation of the height difference between adjacent grid points in the
DEM (SDHD). The standard deviation of the height difference between adjacent
grid points in the DEM has been used as terrain roughness descriptor by some
authors (Evans 1972, Rees 2000). The algorithm used in our case starts from the
interpolated grid DEM with a 262 m spacing. A 363 node mobile window was
shifted over the whole of the interpolated grid DEM. Then, the average height
difference between the central node of the window and the rest of the nodes (eight
closest neighbours) was calculated according to the following expression:

Where ZP is the elevation at the central point of the window (node P) and Zk is the
elevation of each of the eight points surrounding node P. Thus, a mean value of the
height differences around each node of the grid DEM was obtained. The SDHD is
defined as the standard deviation of the set of values DZP.

the terrain roughness (Hobson 1972). In fact, if the regression coefficient R2 is
determined for each fitting, a non-dimensional indicator of the terrain roughness
could be generated using the simple expression SFE512R2. This indicator will be
included between values 0 (optimal fitting of the surface)less roughness) and 1
(worst fitting)maximum roughness).

All the procedures described above were programmed with the SCRIPTERH
module, included in the SURFER 8.01H (Golden Software Inc. 2002), which allows
the use of the tool Active X Automation to work with the SURFER modelling
engine in an environment that is compatible with Visual BasicH.

3. Relationships between DEM accuracy, sampling density, and terrain roughness

First, and foremost, we shall examine the relationships between DEM error,
sampling density, and terrain roughness to explore the morphology that our
empirical model should have. For this purpose, six morphologies were selected from
the eight that were available,
in order to establish and calibrate the different
empirical models tested to estimate the RMSEsurf considering the sample points as
free of error. The morphologies chosen were the following: smooth hillside, rolling1,
slightly mountainous, mountainous, highly rugged, and steep-rugged hillside
(table 1). The two remaining morphologies, flat and rolling2, would be used to
carry out the validation of the empirical models developed.

3.1 DEM error and sampling density

In figure 3, we can observe the relationship between RMSE and sample density N
for the slightly mountainous and steep-rugged hillside morphologies. The variation
of RMSE with increase in sample density is reasonably fitted to a potential
decreasing function, a circumstance observed in other studies (Wang 1990, Aguilar
et al. 2003), which will be fundamental in the structure of the final model.

Table 3 shows the fitting parameters of the potential decreasing model for the data
observed for each of the six morphologies tested. We can appreciate high regression
coefficients which reflect the goodness of the fitting in morphologies as different as
smooth hillside and steep-rugged hillside.

In sections 3.2 and 3.3, the most suitable terrain roughness descriptors to explain

the relief effect on the DEM error will be selected to be included in the model.

3.2 Terrain roughness and sampling density

In the first place, it seems reasonable to request a certain independence from the
terrain descriptor with regard to the spatial distribution and number of original
sample points in the dataset. Thus, the final user of the model can determine the
approximate value of the appropriate descriptor using data previously extracted
from topographic maps (Gao 1995) or DEMs (e.g. in USA: National Elevation
Dataset at the USGS Earth Resources Observation Systems Data Centre; Gesch et
al. 2002). In table 4, one can verify how the descriptors presenting a lower variability
with regard to the number and distribution of sample points are Average Slope and
SDUV. The value calculated for descriptor SDHD is shown as relatively sensitive to
the number and distribution of sample points, especially in the case of mountainous
and slightly mountainous morphologies with coefficients of variation higher than
28%.

In any case, the coefficients of variation calculated show promising results,
especially bearing in mind the range of
sample densities employed (from
N150.00091 points m22 to N950.12255 points m22). In figure 4, we can observe
how the variability in determining descriptors SDUV and SDHD is high, above all

in the case of SDHD for low sample densities (N1 to N4). Starting from sample
density N5, with an equivalent spacing of 6.3 m in grid format, the values of both
descriptors are quite independent from the sample size and the spatial distribution of
sample points because the reliability intervals are very narrow.

3.3 DEM error and terrain roughness

it must be noted that

Second, a good descriptor of the terrain morphology incidence on the DEM error
should present a high relationship with the RMSE of this DEM. A relationship can
be observed between the RMSE and the different terrain descriptors which is very
close to an increasing potential function (figure 5), with high regression coefficients.
However,
the independent observations are not well
distributed in many instances because of the deficient distribution of the descriptor
values. In fact, in figure 5, we can see that large clumps of low SDHD values are
offset by a few high values. Average Slope and SDS have similar problems. This
poor distribution of independent observations can inflate the regression coefficients
unrealistically. Thus, it would be desirable to have at our disposal a vast set of
morphologies uniformly representing the whole roughness spectrum (see section 7).

(bottom) for mountainous terrain. Both roughness descriptors are showed as the mean value
and 95% confidence interval.

Accuracy of grid digital elevation models

183

In any case, using only the Average Slope terrain descriptor R2, values lower than
0.90 were obtained, due to a defective fitting of the model to the morphologies in the
Macael site. Let us recall that these morphologies are constituted by quarry terrains
with a terraced and anthropic relief, where steep slopes and even vertical walls are
predominant (table 1).

On the other hand, the group of descriptors SFE1, SFE2, and SFE3 showed very
low regression coefficients, lower than 0.50 in each case. The inefficiency shown by
the terrain descriptor Surface Fitting Error for the modelling of the DEM error is
due to the fact that it presents a high dependence on the morphological analysis
scale. When we seek to fit a first-, second-, or third-degree surface to terrain with
homogenous behaviour on a large scale, a hillside for example (steep-rugged
hillside), excessively low SFE values are obtained. That is to say, the local roughness
is underestimated. Conversely, let us suppose we wish to fit a first-degree surface, a
flat surface, to the triangular transversal section of a riverbed. In this case, the fitting
will be deficient, and therefore SFE1 will adopt a very high value, although the local
roughness of the riverbed is actually very low.

4. Development of empirical models

Once the relationships between the variables involved in grid DEM error modelling
have been described, we can conclude that the structure of the empirical model
should conform starting from the product of two potential functions, increasing in
the case of the terrain descriptor and decreasing in the case of the sampling density.
In table 5, we can observe the models proposed together with the calibration
parameters obtained by nonlinear regression. The Marquardt iterative search
algorithm was used to determine the estimates that minimize the residual sum of
squares (Draper and Smith 1981).

One can verify how parameter ‘c’ of the potential decreasing function presents
similar values in every model developed, indicating that the variation of the RMSE
with sampling density N is independent of the type of terrain descriptor employed.
On the other hand, one can see how the models containing descriptors SDUV,
SDHD, and SDS present very acceptable results with R2 regression coefficients
higher than 0.94. However, in the case of the SFE group of descriptors, low R2
values have been obtained, thus confirming their inefficacy to model DEM error for
the reasons stated in section 3.3.

Equally, the model that employs Average Slope as descriptor offered a mediocre
fitting to the data observed, as also pointed out in section 3.3 (figure 5). No doubt,
the inclusion of extremely rugged terrain such as that situated in the marble quarries
of Macael, with very steep slopes and terraced and anthropic morphology, has
decreased the efficacy of Average Slope to model the RMSE of the grid DEM
generated.

Based on experimental tests, Ackermann (1980) established that the relationship
between DEM error and sampling interval is linear. Likewise, he obtained linear
relationships between the mean slope of an area and the error of a DEM. Both
findings led him to formulate the following model.

s2

~K1s2

raw

zK2(Dxtana)2

ð19Þ

where Dx denotes the sampling interval, tana is the mean slope of the area, s2
raw is
the error variance of raw data (error of sample data measurements), and s2
DEM is
the error variance of the final DEM. Parameters K1 and K2 were later added by Li
(1993a). If the sample data points are supposed to be free of error (s2
raw50), we
have a very similar model to the empirical one proposed in this study where Average
Slope is used as descriptor. In fact, applying the equation (19) model to our data, an
R2 value of 0.68 is obtained, a similar value to that presented in table 5. When the
data from the two Macael morphologies (steep-rugged hillside and highly rugged)
are removed in the regression analysis, the value of R2 increases to 0.92. Thus, it can
be concluded that the Average Slope can be a good roughness descriptor for terrain
with geomorphology modelled by natural processes and where slopes are neither
extreme nor too variable, at least on a local scale.

The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Standard Deviation of Residuals (SDR)
values shown in table 5 confirm what has been stated above. Those models based on
descriptors SDUV, SDHD, and Standard Deviation of Slope show a lower MAE
and SDR than those based on the Average Slope and SFE. That is to say, all the
differences between the RMSE values observed and fitted by the model are lower
and present moreover a lower dispersion with regard to the mean value. The
quantitative differences in the data fitting observed in models SDUV, SDHD, and
Standard Deviation of Slope are unimportant, judging by the R2, MAE, and SDR
values. In any case, it must be stressed that although the SDHD model shows a
slightly higher dispersion of residuals than model SDUV, the MAE value is lower,
which indicates the existence of a series of point residuals with a high absolute value
which artificially increases the value of the SDR, hence the decrease in the regression
coefficient (see figure 6).

Figure 6 shows the plots of the differences between the observed and the fitted
RMSEs for terrain descriptors SDHD, SDUV, Average Slope, and Standard
Deviation of Slope. We can highlight how the majority of the empirical models show
problems for modelling the RMSEs computed in the steep-rugged hillside and

highly rugged morphologies of Macael. The errors registered when using the
Average Slope model are systematic (overestimation in the case of steep-rugged
hillside and underestimation in the case of highly rugged terrain), highly dependent
on sampling density (noticeable decrease in error when sampling density increases)
and have a high maximum value (between 27 and 6 m). The model based on
the Standard Deviation of Slope presents a better fitting to the data observed in
the two Macael morphologies, although a certain asymmetry of the residuals can be
observed, which indicates a tendency to underestimate the RMSE in these
morphologies. On the other hand, this last model fits the mountainous and
slightly mountainous morphologies slightly worse than that based on the Average
Slope. Although the results offered by models SDHD and SDUV may seem similar
a priori, a detailed analysis of figure 6 allows us to establish that the model using
the SDHD descriptor presents a higher symmetry around the horizontal axis of
0 residual, which indicates
the
RMSE observed. Thus, when sample densities are low, the SDUV tends to
underestimate the RMSE values observed in the rolling1 and slightly mountainous
morphologies whilst, at

Another aspect to be considered in the empirical models developed is the
variability of the predicted RMSE with regard to the configuration of the original
sample points. All the models developed have shown a mean variability, expressed
as coefficient of variation,
lower than 10% (table 6), which can be considered
acceptable. We must highlight that the relative variability with regard to the sample
density shown by the SDHD descriptor (table 4) has been smoothed by the value of
parameters ‘a’ and ‘b’ obtained in the empirical model fitting (table 5).

Finally, the use of global terrain variability measures only makes sense in
calculating the global error of a grid DEM working over the same area where the
terrain descriptor has been calculated, i.e. there is an implicit assumption that
descriptor variability is stationary across the study area. Obviously, it would be
desirable for DEM accuracy to be a local variability function rather than a single,
possibly quite misleading, global average. However, it is difficult and sometimes
unapproachable, at least in practice, in the mapping production environment. Note
that although Slope has been found to be the most important terrain-surface
descriptor and is widely used in surveying and mapping (Balce 1987, Li 1993b), it
presents a remarkable dependency on the characterization scale. In fact, since the
scale is arbitrarily defined and not necessarily related to the scale of characterization
required, the derived results may not always be appropriate (Wood 1996). Indeed,
Slope is considered scarcely useful to estimate local roughness or to detect variation
at a finer scale than DEM. For instance, let us consider two surfaces: one is a plain
tilted at 10u. The other is a moderately varying field with an Average Slope of 10u.
The two surfaces present the same Average Slope, but their corresponding grid
DEMs will probably present a different global error because the local roughness can
be remarkably different.

Thus, terrain descriptors more sensitive to changes in local roughness (e.g.
SDHD, SDS or SDUV) can perform better than those more centred to describe the
roughness variation on a coarser scale (e.g. Average Slope or SFE).

5. Validation of empirical models

Although the observations discussed in the previous section point to the model
based on terrain descriptor SDHD as the most appropriate, the results had to be
validated on morphologies not used in the calibration of empirical models. This
validation was carried out on the flat and rolling2 morphologies (table 1). In

Accuracy of grid digital elevation models

187

figure 7, we can see the plots of the maximum and minimum RMSE (by means of the
95% confidence interval) versus the sampling density for predicted and observed
data on flat terrain. The empirical models based on terrain descriptors SDHD,
Standard Deviation of Slope, SDUV, and Average Slope were tested. As we stated
previously, the model that best reproduced the data observed on flat terrain was
based on the SDHD descriptor, closely followed by the one based on the Standard
Deviation of Slope. The SDUV model underestimated the observed RMSE, whereas
the Average Slope did the opposite, probably because it was calibrated with a very
high Average Slope.

In figure 8, the validation carried out on the rolling2 morphology is shown. The
behaviour of the four models developed is similar to that observed on flat terrain,
although in this case the SDHD model showed itself as clearly superior to the
others. In every model, we can observe a slight overestimation of the observed
RMSE at high-level densities. Once more the Average Slope model presented a
tendency to overestimate the observed data, a circumstance that in this case can also
be seen in the Standard Deviation of Slope.

6. Conclusions

In this study, a theoretical-empirical model has been developed which determines
the error that occurs when modelling the terrain surface from randomly spaced data
points that are converted into regularly gridded data points using triangulation with
linear interpolation. The model consists of a theoretical part based on the error
propagation theory, and of an empirical part which attempts to determine the value
of what is known as Information Loss (RMSEIL), i.e. the error due purely to
sampling with a finite grid interval and to using linear interpolation of the terrain
surface (Huang 2000). The empirical models developed present a morphology based
on the product of two potential functions, an increasing one related to terrain
roughness, and a decreasing one related to sample density. Some of the bi-variant
empirical models developed explain with reasonable accuracy (R2.0.94) the global
error of a grid DEM in terms of Root Mean Square Error. To be specific, the results
obtained in this study allow us to highlight the empirical model based on the SDHD
terrain descriptor as the one that best reproduces, both on a calibration level and on
a validation level, the observed grid DEM error in the majority of the morphologies
studied, considering that the sample data points are free of error. Thus, bearing in
mind the theoretical development shown in sections 2.2 and 2.3, the average value
for the error of a grid DEM linearly constructed from scattered sample data,
RMSEsurf (m), can be expressed by means of the following equation:

ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

7. Further works

that

Apart from the descriptors based on the Surface Fitting Error (SFE), which have
been proved totally inefficient for modelling the grid DEM error, the rest of the
terrain descriptors tested have shown certain advantages and disadvantages. In our
case, the SDHD model has proved to be the one that best reproduced the RMSE
observed in the eight morphologies studied. We must point out
these
morphologies presented a very broad range of slopes and ruggedness, due basically
to the inclusion of the quarry soils located in Macael. On the other hand, terrain
descriptors Average Slope and SDUV have shown a lower variability than SDHD
with regard to the number and distribution of the sample points, which can be
considered as favourable elements. In short, it is likely that a single ideal terrain
descriptor does not exist for all morphology types that can be found in practice.
Each one represents an optimal application range. Thus, we would recommend the
inclusion in the empirical model of a particular descriptor with regard to the
objective parameters of each terrain, such as its mean slope or its roughness
(measured with the SDUV indicator, for example). For the ‘a` la carte’ development
of these models we should have at our disposal a vast set of morphologies uniformly
representing the whole roughness spectrum. This terrain dataset could be implemented
generating synthetic self-similar surfaces with, for example, a fractional Brownian
process using a range of values for the fractal dimension (Goodchild and Mark 1987).
An infinitely rugged surface should have a limiting fractal dimension of 3, whereas a
smooth surface should have a fractal dimension of 2.
