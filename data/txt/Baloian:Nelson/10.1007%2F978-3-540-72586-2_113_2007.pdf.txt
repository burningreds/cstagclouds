Abstract.  Participatory  simulations  are  collaborative  group  learning  activities 
whose goals are to improve teaching and learning, increasing motivation inside 
the  classroom  by  engaging  the  learner  in  games  simulating  a  certain  system 
they have to learn about. It has been already applied to students of primary and 
secondary  educational  levels,  however  there  are  still  not  experiences  reported 
with higher level students, although there are many learning subjects to which 
this  technique  can  be  applied.  This  paper  presents  the  implementation  of  a 
framework-like tool for supporting learning activities in a business school with 
undergraduate students using mobile devices over an ad-hoc network.

1   Introduction 

Any experienced teacher knows that without the proper motivation for students to engage in 
a learning experience, the otherwise best designed experiences will be unsuccessful. Dick 
and  Carey [8]  state:  “Many  instructors consider  the  motivation level of learners the  most 
important factor in successful instruction”. “Motivation is not only important because it is a 
necessary causal factor of learning, but because it mediates learning and is a consequence of 
learning as well” [20]. In other words, students who are motivated to learn will have greater 
success  than  those  who  are  not.  Participatory  Simulation  aims  for  students  having  “rich 
conceptual resources for reasoning abut and thoughtfully acting in playful and motivational 
spaces, and thus can more easily become highly engaged in the subject matter” [11]. It uses 
the availability of mobile computing devices to give each student the capability of simple 
data exchanges among neighboring devices [19], [4]. They enable students to act as agents in 
simulations  in  which  overall  patterns  emerge  from  local  decisions  and  information 
exchanges.  Such  simulations  enable  students  to  model  and  learn  about  several  types  of 
phenomena, [4] including those related to economics [4], [9]. 

Some research groups have implemented collaborative learning participatory simulations 
with handhelds and infrared beaming [16], and it has been found that this kind of activities

provide  various  advantages  for  teaching  and  learning:  (a)  they  introduce  an  effective 
instructional  tool  and  have  the  potential  to  impact  student  learning  positively  across 
curricular topics and instructional activities [18], (b) they increase the motivation [12], [4], 
and  (c)  they  generate  positive  effects  in  engagement,  self-directed  learning  and  problemsolving 
[12]. 

Although handheld’s most natural data-entry mode is the stylus, most currently available 
handheld  applications  adopt  the  PC  application  approach  that  uses  widgets  instead  of 
freehand-input-based paradigms (via touch screens) and/or sketching, [6]. 

This  paper  presents  a  tool  for  implementing  collaborative  learning  participatory 
simulations,  having  two  general  research  goals:  (a)  propose  a  conceptual  framework  for 
specifying  and  developing  participative  simulation  applications,  and  (b)  to  determine  the 
feasibility of using this in undergraduate curricular contexts of the simulation activities both 
in terms of intended and actualized learning outcomes; particularly in the management area. 
An  instance of  the  framework  is described. Its  implementation is  simple,  lightweight  and 
fully based on wirelessly interconnected handhelds with an ad-hoc network. 

2   Related Work  

A learning participatory simulation is a role-playing activity that helps to explain the 
coherence of complex and dynamic systems. The system maps a problem of the real 
world  to  a  model  with  a  fixed  number  of  roles  and  rules.  Global  knowledge  and 
patterns emerge in Participatory Simulations from local interactions among users and 
making  decisions  to  understand  the  impact  by  an  analysis  and  observation  while 
doing and/or at the end of the activity.  

Researchers  are  highly 

learning  participatory 
simulations  due  to  these  simulations  appear  to  make  very  difficult  ideas  around 
‘distributed  systems’  and  ‘emergent  behavior’  more  accessible  to  students  [19] 
motivating its learning process in a playful social space [4]. 

in  collaborative 

interested 

Various systems using different hardware devices have been already implemented: 
•  A futures trading simulation described on [2] enhances the learning process of concepts 
such as price discovery, the open outcry trading method, trading strategies of locals and 
brokers, and the impact of interest rates on the treasury bond futures contract. 

•  Thinking  Tags  [1]  uses  small  nametag  sized  computers  that  communicate  with  each 
other. It was used to tech high-school students in a simulation of virus propagation and 
asked them to determine the rules of the propagation [5]. 

•  NetLogo [17] is an environment for developing of learning participatory simulations for 
PCs.  Simulations  can  be  re-played,  analyzed  and  compared  with  previous  ones.  An 
extension  called HubNet [19] supports PCs and mobile devices for input and output. 

•  Klopfer  et  al.  [12]  showed  that  the  newer  and  more  easily  distributable  version  of 
Participatory Simulations on handhelds was equally as capable as the original Tag-based 
simulations  in  engaging  students  collaboratively  in  a  complex  problem-solving  task. 
They  feel  that  handhelds  technology  holds  great  promise  for  promoting  collaborative 
learning  as  teachers  struggle  to  find  authentic  ways  to  integrate  technology  into  the 
classroom in addition to engaging and motivating students to learn science.

•  A  collaborative  learning  participatory  simulation  in  form  of  a  stock  exchange  was 
designed for master’s students in financial theory, using architectures based on a server 
and clients running on desktop PCs or laptops as well as on PDAs, [13]. 

•  The SimCafé experiments belong to the sociological approach, aiming at validating and 
consolidating  models  [9],  [4].  In  this  approach,  participants  are  stakeholders  and  the 
witnesses of the emergence are domain experts, usually social scientists.  

Based on the literature above mentioned, we have identified that no system has yet 
been  proposed  or  implemented  for  handhelds  in  a  wireless  ad-hoc  network  using  a 
pen-based interface as main metaphor for user interaction. 

3   Developing a Framework  

In accordance to [7] and [20] some factors, based on empirical evidence, to enhance 
motivation are: 
• 

Involve  the  learner.  Learners  must  be  involved  in  the  ownership  of  the  goals, 
strategies and assessment of that with which they are to be engaged. The students 
must to fell that they are in control of their own learning.  

•  Respond  positively  to  questions  posed  by  students  can  enhance  intrinsic 
motivation. Furthermore, consideration should be given to what the learner brings 
to the classroom: experiences, interests, and other resources.  

•  Options  and  choices  about  the  learning  environment  and  the  various 
curriculum components (persons, time, content, methods, etc.) must be available.  
•  Simulating the reality. Whatever the expected learning outcomes, there must be 

a direct connection with the real world outside the classroom. 

•  The  shifting  of  responsibility  for  learning  from  the  teacher  to  the  student  is 

fundamental to both content fulfillment and learner motivation.  

•  Feedback  and  reinforcement  are  essential  to  good  teaching  and  effective 
learning. When learners are given positive reinforcement, a source of motivation 
is  tapped.  Evaluation  should  be  based on  the  task,  rather  than  comparison  with 
performance of other students. 

•  Collaboration  among  learners  is  a  very  potent  way  in  which  an  individual 
learner forms an interpretation of the environment and develops understanding in 
motivational spaces of social interactions.  

Collaborative  learning  applications  based  on  Participative  Simulations  are  able  to 
meet the requirements listed above. In order to generate, design and implement them 
the Teacher must define learning goals, artifacts to be exchanged, behavior variables 
and parameters, and rules and roles for playing the simulation. In order to configure 
the  system  for  a  collaborative  learning  participatory  simulation,  the  Teacher  may 
setup transferable objects, their behavior parameters, rules and participant roles. Then, 
the  teacher  explains  the  goal  of  the  activity  to  the  students,  also  describing  objects, 
rules  and  roles,  and  how  these  concepts  are  represented  in  their  handhelds.  Rules, 
roles  and  goals  should  be  designed  to  achieve  a  high  social  interaction  between 
students, negotiation instances, and competition to encourage an active and motivated 
stance [13]. A startup process must ensure students will play an active and dynamic 

802

role. This should be based on defining trading activities between students including 
Negotiation  and  Exchange  of  Objects  which  is  supported  by  handhelds.  These 
conditions  depend  on  each  particular  application  and  may  involve  the  following 
aspects: (a) type of exchange objects, (b) exchange amounts, (c) trade conditions, (d) 
parameters  before  and  after  the  exchange,  and  (e)  exchange  objects.  If  students 
require  assistance,  our  framework  allows  the  teacher  to  wirelessly  give  them 
feedback  and  assessment.  The  teacher  can  (a)  observe  the  simulation  state  of  each 
participant device and (b) modify such state in order to solve the student inquiry. 

Fig. 1. Conceptual framework 

 

Once the simulation is done, the teacher must guide students’ understanding about 
the  activity.  In  this  way,  the  students  will  construct  the  learning  objective  together, 
analyzing different stages of the activity. 

4   Applications Implemented Using the Framework 

We  have  implemented  a  lightweight  platform  for  supporting  the  implementation  of 
participatory simulation applications based on the framework proposed in section 3. Using 
this platform we have successfully implemented two applications for the scenarios proposed 
on the previous section. The platform is a collection of java-classes which can be extended to 
implement the desired scenario in a very fast and easy way. They allow the definition of new 
roles,  new  products  and  the  rules  which  will  govern  the  simulation.  It  also  offers 
implementation of interfaces for assigning roles and exchange goods, which are should be 
extended to implement the details of the desired application. The platform also implements 
all  the  necessary  actions  to  discover  other  applications  of  the  same  class  running  on 
handhelds within the ad-hoc network and opens the necessary communication channels to 
exchange data between them. 

4.1   Trust Building Simulation 

This application is aimed to support the learning of concepts like reputation and trust 
by undergraduate students of business schools. In the simulated situation the roles of 

  Developing Motivating Collaborative Learning Through Participatory Simulations 

803 

vendors and customers are implemented. Customers are required to maintain a certain 
basket  with  products  they  can  acquire  goods  from  vendors.  Products  have  a  certain 
lifespan  which  is  known  at  the  purchase  moment.  Customers  have  to  replace  them 
when  they  expire.  The  simulation  assigns  a  random  lifetime  to  the  products  around 
the  expected  one.  If  the  product  fails  before  the  lifetime  offered  by  the  vendor 
customers  may  claim  money  refund  or  product  replacement.  Vendors  can  advertise 
their products freely offering a longer lifetime to attract customers or a shorter to gain 
customers’ trust. They may refuse to refund the money or replace the product in order 
to make better profit. In the real world, the customers’ trust to the companies is built 
by a repetitive interaction. A positive evaluation usually is generated when products 
quality is satisfactory or, even, when the company reacts appropriately after a client’s 
complain  about  bad  products  (or  services).  When  the  simulation  finishes,  students 
must  analyze  these  results  and  conclude  about  how  clients’  trust  impacts  the 
companies’ profit. 

 

Fig. 2. a) Teacher drags a student icon into the “vendor” area to assign him a new role. b) Teacher can 
create new goods using free-hand drawings. 
 
Setup  phase:  To  assign  roles  to  the  students  (customer  or  vendor)  the  teacher  uses  the 
"activity  administration"  mode.  Students  without  roles  are  displayed  in  the  middle  of  the 
screen  over  a  white  area.  The  right  area  of  handhelds  (figure  2.a)  has  “vendors”  and  left 
belongs  to  “consumers”.  The  teacher  assigns  roles  by  drag-and-dropping  the  icon  of  a 
student  into  the  desired  area.  Since  in  this  application  goods  may  be  anything,  they  are 
created by the teacher by drawing a sketch and surround it by a rectangle. This will produce 
a "good icon", displaying an awareness of successful creation and displaying a reduced icon 
of the original scratch in the bottom bound of the screen. Then, additional "goods icons" may 
be created, as seen in Figure 2.b.  

Double-clicking  on  a  "goods  icon"  will  open  a  window  for  defining  default 
variables  for  that  type  of  good.  In  this  application,  instance  variables  are  "original 
price", "production time" and "product expected life". Once goods have been created 
their icons will show up in "activity administration mode". The teacher assigns goods 
to  patricians  by  dragging  the  goods  icons  over  the  vendor  icons  to  allow  them  to 
produce this item, or over consumer icons to ask them to acquire this item. 

804 

G. Zurita et al. 

Simulation  phase:  The  simulation  starts  by  vendors  offering  their  products  verbally  and 
customers  looking  for  the  most  convenient  offer  in  terms  of  price  and  lifetime.  Once  a 
customer  faces  a  vendor,  they  face  their  handhelds  in  order  to  activate  the  IrDA 
communication.  This  will  enable  the  customer  to  receive  information  about  the  vendor’s 
reputation and allow customer and vendor make the transaction. Figure 3 shows the 
three steps required to complete the transaction. When facing both handhelds the top 
region of the screen is converted in the negotiation area. The vendor drags the product 
to  this  area,  which  will  appear  on  the  buyer’s  negotiation  area,  who  accepts  it  by 
dragging  it  to  the  area  of  products  owned.  The  clients  keep  information  of  the 
reputation of each vendor with a number ranking the vendors. At the beginning it has 
no  value.  The  client  can  set  and  alter  this  number  after  according  to  the  interaction 
they had with vendor and also by asking other customers about the opinion they have 
from a vendor.

customer accepts it, the vendor’s stock and customer requirements/acquired lists get updated. 

4.2   Stock Market Simulation 

This application is about learning how offer and demand are impacted by expectations 
and speculations. This is learnt by simulating a stock market situation. The only role 
present  in  this  simulation  is  the  one  of  the  investor  who  has  to  buy  and  sell  shares 
trying to make profit. The teacher takes part in the simulation introducing changes in 
the scenario by varying the prices of the overall company. She can also participate by 
offering  and  buying  shares  in  order  to  create  unexpected  situations  simulating 
speculations. Students and teacher can after the simulation analyze the reactions of the 
simulated marked.

805 

Setup  phase:  In  this  scenario  there  is  no  role  assignment  action  since  all  have  the 
same one. The goods are now the shares of different companies the investors can buy 
and  sell.  The  teacher  creates  the  different  shares  in  the  same  way  like  the  previous 
application. Every investor receives an initial amount of shares and money.  
Simulation phase: The simulation starts by letting the investors offer and buy their 
shares. Figure 4 a) shows the interface of the application. Students can see the amount 
of shares and their value, value and amount, and a small graph with the history of the 
values  with a pull-down  menu. Shares are traded using IrDA detection. Figure 4 b) 
shows the three steps necessary to transfer shares among students when they agree on 
the price and amount of the shares to be traded. When facing both handhelds, from the 
buyer and seller, the region at the top of the screen is converted in the trade area. The 
seller  drags  the  object  representing  the  share  to  this  area,  triggering  at  the  buyer’s 
handheld a dialog in order to enter the amount of shares and the money. Then the data 
of both is updates accordingly.

5   Discussion and Future Work 

First results of this ongoing work have shown us that mobile technology is a right approach 
for implementing participatory simulations. In fact, one of the most motivating factors of this 
kind of learning activities is the face-to-face interaction students can have among each other. 
Technology plays a very subtle yet important role, letting the social interaction to be at the 
center of the experience. On the other hand, we could experience that the platform is really a 
helpful  tool  for  supporting  the  development  of  applications  implementing  participatory 
simulations  and  other  games  that  are  based  on  the  exchange  of  artifact  between  the 
participants. The development time required for the subsequent applications can be reduced 
to less than 1/3 of the time. We believe that the most significant contribution of the work 
reported here is to provide a conceptual framework for applications of collaborative learning 

806

participatory simulations, which is easy to adapt to many subject-matter content knowledge 
and undergraduate curricular integration and encouraging the adoption of learner-centered 
strategies. The teachers, who pre-evaluate the application, suggest that the same technologies 
and ideas could be used across many subject matter areas. The design of effective learning 
environments of our conceptual framework have included (a) learner centered environment 
(learners  construct  their  own  meanings),  (b)  knowledge-centered  environment  (learners 
connect  information  into  coherent  wholes  and  embedding  information  in  a  context),  (c) 
assessment-centered  environment  (learner  use  formative  and  summative  assessment 
strategies  and  feedback),  and  (d)  community-centered  environments  (learner  work  in 
collaborative learning norms). The next phase of our investigations will develop and explore 
more  subject-specific  applications  and  learning  and  motivational  measures  at  the  student 
level. We are also working on developing an application which can let the teacher define a 
participatory simulation application without having to program a single line, only defining 
the roles, products and rules for exchanging products. In the current platform a language for 
defining these rules which could be used to generate the application is missing.
