Introduction
Software development is an increasingly complex and dynamic activity. 
Development frequently occurs in teams that perform parallel development on 
the same application, often in geographically distributed locations. Multiple 
versions of applications need to be supported, and they often must run on 
different machines and operating systems. 

Increased economic pressures, auditory and regulatory compliance mandates 
and development process and technology complexity further intensify today’s 
software development challenges. As a result, many problems can occur during 
software development, including: 

•  Bugs that have been corrected reappear 
•  Previous releases of software are impossible to find or cannot be rebuilt 
•  Files mysteriously change or disappear altogether
•  Work from one developer is replaced (lost) by work from another developer
•  Builds that previously worked suddenly break
•  Development team workload cannot be easily tracked
•  Project status cannot be easily monitored and assessed
•  It is difficult to determine what bugs have been fixed in a release and what code 

changes were made to fix those bugs

How can these problems be reduced—or even eliminated? The answer is 
software configuration management, or SCM. In this paper, you will discover 
the key reasons why software configuration management is critical for business 
success. The paper discusses how IBM® Rational® ClearCase® and IBM 
Rational ClearQuest® change management solutions provide advanced SCM 
capabilities that can increase productivity, improve software quality and deliver 
maximum business value. It explains how Rational ClearCase and Rational 
ClearQuest are integrated with Rational Developer products, including IBM 
Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software and IBM Rational 
Web Developer for WebSphere Software, as well as with the open source Eclipse 
framework for seamless access to SCM capabilities from within your integrated 
development environment (IDE). This paper also presents best practices for 
using Rational ClearCase and Rational ClearQuest from within Rational 
Developer products and Eclipse to enable more efficient development.

Why software configuration management?
Software configuration management (SCM) helps to establish and maintain the 
integrity of software products throughout the development life cycle. Through 
capabilities such as version control, build management, defect and change 
tracking, release management and process control, SCM can help deliver: 

•  Increased productivity through parallel development and automated processes
•  Better operational efficiency through improved team communication and 

collaboration, support for large distributed teams, enhanced reliability and minimized 
downtime

•  Reduced cost through the leveraging of existing investments and increased software reuse
•  Faster time-to-market through streamlined development and reduced release/build 

cycle times

•  Enhanced software quality by preventing users from making mistakes and reducing 

bugs in delivered code

•  Increased ability to meet compliance requirements with a well-defined, repeatable, 

auditable process

By protecting and managing business-critical software assets and by 
automating and enforcing the development process, SCM tools can help enable 
development teams to produce higher-quality software faster and with lower 
cost and risk. The key is to implement SCM tools that can easily integrate with 
existing systems and development environments. 

Improve productivity and gain long-term value with industry-leading SCM solutions 
IBM Rational change management products, including IBM Rational 
ClearCase and IBM Rational ClearQuest, lead the SCM tools market.1 Part of 
the IBM Rational Team Unifying Platform™, a set of integrated tools that span 
the full application development life cycle, IBM Rational change management 
products deliver proven technology to help developers and project managers 
effectively manage change and assets.

“The integration of Rational ClearCase 
and Rational Application Developer for 
WebSphere Software allows for better 
productivity. From the learning curve 
perspective, it seems like one 
application. You don’t have to learn 
two full-blown applications. By having 
everything in one application, 
developers can get up to speed very 
quickly. This allows our developers to 
get back to what they do best, which is 
developing code—not learning the 
application software.”

Going well beyond software revision control and versioning capabilities, 
Rational ClearCase and Rational ClearQuest deliver advanced SCM capabilities 
that provide development team members with instant, controlled access to the 
information they need to create, update, build, deliver, reuse and maintain 
business-critical software assets that can be developed faster and at lower cost. 

Rational ClearCase: So much more than version control 
Rational ClearCase products provide an extensive range of software asset 
management capabilities. From IBM Rational ClearCase LT to IBM Rational 
ClearCase to IBM Rational ClearCase MultiSite® change management 
solutions, organizations can choose the Rational ClearCase product that best 
meets their development needs. 

Rational ClearCase LT provides version control for small to midsize collocated 
teams. Easy to install and manage, Rational ClearCase LT offers: 

•  Version control for files, directories or other assets produced during the development 

life cycle, with annotated histories of source code, binaries, executables, 
documentation, test suites, libraries and Web elements. 

•  Automated workspace configuration with snapshot views. These views give easy 

access to the correct versions of files and directories required to complete a specific 
task while shielding team members from potentially destabilizing changes being 
made by other developers. This is done by loading the required versions of files and 
directories onto the developer’s desktop—a feature ideally suited to disconnected users 
and early-stage projects that require isolation 

•  Parallel development support, including automatic branching to enable multiple 
development teams to work independently from the same code base, and proven 
diff/merge technology that automatically accepts uncontested changes and highlights 
conflicting changes for fast resolution. 

•  Remote client interface enables remote developers to access versioned objects in a 

centralized repository via a wide-area network (WAN) or a virtual private network 
(VPN) connection. The remote client interface uses automatic update technology 
(based on the Eclipse Update Manager technology) to allow users and administrators 
to manage the updates of many clients by simply pointing at the server’s URL and 
auto-updating the client with new versions. 

•  Web interface offers easy access from standard Web browsers virtually anytime, 

anywhere.

•  Tight integration with Rational ClearQuest provides smooth access to workflow 

management and change and defect tracking. 

•  Wide operating system support includes support for Linux®, Microsoft® Windows® 

and UNIX® operating systems.

•  Easy installation is the result of intuitive startup wizards to automate server setup and 

built-in TCP/IP networking for simplified administration in heterogeneous environments. 

•  Deep integration with leading IDEs including Rational Developer products, IBM 
WebSphere® Studio, Microsoft Visual Studio® .NET and the open source Eclipse 
framework.

•  File conversion from other version control and SCM products, including CVS, to 

speed migration activities. 

•  Seamless upgrade to Rational ClearCase enables organizations to grow and meet 

evolving business needs without retraining, retooling or migrating data. 

Rational ClearCase provides complete software asset management for midsize to 
large development teams. It extends the value of Rational ClearCase LT by adding: 

•  Flexible workspace management using dynamic or snapshot views. Dynamic 

views, provide global, transparent access to virtually any version of any element—a 
feature ideal for an audited build environment or a complex project that requires 
instantaneous updates to evolving source files 

•  Advanced build management to automatically produce a detailed bill of materials, 

re-create any previous build at any time, and provide build avoidance capabilities so 
developers do not spend time building files that have already been built by another 
developer

•  Support for multiple repository server deployments for large-scale enterprise teams 
•  Mainframe development support, including IBM OS/390® and IBM eServer zSeries® 

platforms running SUSE LINUX operating systems 

•  Seamless addition of Rational ClearCase MultiSite that enables parallel development 

across geographically distributed environments

Rational ClearCase MultiSite is an optional addition to Rational ClearCase that 
enables parallel development across geographically distributed environments, 
offering: 

•  Distributed development support enabling distributed teams on multiple distributed 

servers to create complex applications in parallel through automatic replication

 “It is not good if your project has 200 
developers and it takes on the order of 
36 hours to complete the compile 
process each time someone wants to 
rebuild the product. With Rational 
ClearCase, we were able to reduce that 
time to about 30 minutes.”

Rational ClearQuest: Flexible defect and change tracking and workflow management
Rational ClearQuest captures and manages all types of change requests 
throughout the development life cycle, including defects, enhancements, issues 
and documentation changes. Out-of-the-box, predefined workflows enable 
development teams to get up and running quickly. Workflows, as well as the 
user interface, defect and change request fields, queries and charts can also be 
easily customized using simple point-and-click features.

Simplifying development through activity-based change management 
Activity-based change management allows you to manage and track individual 
changes to software assets throughout the application life cycle as higherlevel 
activities rather than as changes to individual files and directories. 
Managing activities instead of their related assets within the context of the 
overall development process provides greater clarity and insight. It streamlines 
and simplifies the development process, enabling development teams to work 
together more efficiently and effectively. 

Rational ClearCase and Rational ClearQuest enable activity-based change 
management through Unified Change Management (UCM), the set of features 
within these products that enables you to define and manage changes to 
software assets as activities. With UCM you can associate specific versions of 
files and directories with activities. Operations, such as delivering code to the 
integration stream, are then performed on the activity instead of on individual 
files. This level of abstraction reduces the build and integration errors caused 
by developers forgetting which files they modified when delivering their 
changes. It also helps ensure that testing is performed against the versions 
of files being integrated. The status of activities in Rational ClearQuest is 
automatically updated when developers work on them in Rational ClearCase, 
helping keep the project status up to date.

By enabling this activity-centric approach, project members (including 
project leaders, developers, testers and customer support) can communicate 
more effectively. Developers can get up and running quickly on new projects. 
Teams can effectively baseline requirements together with code, models, test 
assets and more. Project managers can easily manage and track the status 
of proposed changes and better understand the impact of proposed changes 
across the project.

Through UCM, Rational ClearCase and Rational ClearQuest also provide 
customizable, automated workflows that consistently enforce the development 
process. From submitting change requests to assigning those requests to 
resolving and verifying changes, you have full control over how each change is 
managed and implemented.

By managing change through high-level activities and by managing the change 
process through workflows, Rational ClearCase and Rational ClearQuest can 
enable you to:

•  Streamline code reviews and testing efforts
•  Reduce build and integration problems
•  Automate the development process
•  Facilitate reporting
•  Simplify project management

Start with an effective IDE 
To meet your business objectives, it is critical to enable diverse development 
teams across your enterprise to deliver high-quality applications quickly. 
Developers need a development environment that supports the entire 
development life cycle—from development to integration and testing to ongoing 
maintenance. 

Eclipse: Flexible open source technology 
Eclipse is an open, extensible industry-supported platform designed for 
building diverse applications such as Web sites, embedded Java™ programs 
and C++ programs. Fast becoming a popular framework for cross-platform 
development, Eclipse offers many benefits to developers, including: 

•  Cross-platform support for Linux, Windows, Solaris, IBM AIX 5L® and HP-UX 

operating environments

•  A familiar and intuitive graphical project workspace
•  Smooth integration of tools and features through plug-ins 
•  Support for both graphical user interface (GUI)- and non-GUI-based application 

development

•  Availability at no charge to developers under an open source license

By providing a common interface, an optimized process that closely parallels 
how developers work and the ability to support collaborative development with 
a common user model, the Eclipse platform is designed to enable increased 
productivity while leveraging existing and newly acquired tools. 

Rational Developer products: Extending the value of Eclipse 
Rational Developer products provide a flexible, portal-like integration of 
multi-language, multi-platform and multi-device application development 
tools. They are designed to enable developers to rapidly build, test and deploy 
dynamic applications. Visual tools, templates and wizards help developers 
quickly and easily perform many development tasks—from building dynamic 
Web sites and Web applications to developing advanced enterprise applications 
that span disparate platforms. 

Rational Developer products can provide a single development environment 
that can scale to support multiple types of development, including Web, 
business logic, integration and traditional development. As a result, all the 
developers on a team use the same environment—customized to meet their 
individual development needs—and can easily collaborate as they develop 
applications. 

Rational Developer products include: 

•  IBM Rational Web Developer for WebSphere Software, an easy-to-use, highly 

productive development environment with visual rapid application development (RAD) 
tools for building and maintaining dynamic Web, Web services and Java applications 

•  IBM Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software, a comprehensive 

development environment with high-productivity tools for building and maintaining 
Web, Web services, Java, Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE™) and portal applications

“Having Rational ClearCase and 
Rational ClearQuest integrated with 
Eclipse enables our developers to 
work faster, simply because they are 
not switching between multiple 
interfaces. Additionally, they get better 
performance by not having as many 
tools open on their desktop.”

—BearingPoint, Inc. 

Rational Developer products are built on Eclipse technology. They are designed 
to enable developers to maximize productivity by integrating best-of-breed 
plug-in tools from IBM, IBM Business Partners and the Eclipse community to 
customize their development environment to match their roles and needs. This 
integration enables developers to focus on delivering a solution that satisfies 
their requirements instead of switching between various development tools. 

Integrated SCM is the key 
If the goal is to develop higher quality applications faster and at lower cost, then 
the speed and ease with which development tasks can be performed is a major 
consideration. As discussed, effective SCM tools can improve productivity and 
reduce cost. However, performing change management operations from within 
their IDE allows developers to “stay in one place” and access SCM functions in 
the same familiar way they access other IDE functions, dramatically improving 
productivity.

World-class SCM integrated with Rational Developer products and Eclipse 
Rational ClearCase and Rational ClearQuest are integrated with a variety of 
IDEs, including Rational Web Developer for WebSphere Software, Rational 
Application Developer for WebSphere Software and Eclipse. From within 
these Rational Developer products and Eclipse, developers can directly access 
Rational ClearCase and Rational ClearQuest functions. Rational Application 
Developer for WebSphere Software also makes it easier for teams to get started 
with SCM by including the Rational ClearCase LT software.

Rational ClearCase and Rational ClearQuest functions are exposed through 
product perspectives, views, menus, toolbars and context-sensitive pop-up 
menus. This allows Rational and Eclipse developers to interact with Rational 
ClearCase and Rational ClearQuest in the same way they interact with their 
IDEs. It also enables Rational and Eclipse developers to efficiently support 
collaborative development with a common user model. Additionally, the 
Rational ClearCase and Rational ClearQuest integrations provide several 
operations to help streamline and automate common tasks, further improving 
developer productivity.

IBM Rational ClearCase and IBM Rational ClearQuest
Page 11

Although Rational ClearCase and Rational ClearQuest functions are accessed the 
same way from both Rational Developer products and Eclipse, the remainder of this 
discussion is specific to Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software.

Accessing IBM Rational ClearCase 
To access IBM Rational ClearCase functions from within Rational Application 
Developer for WebSphere Software, the Rational ClearCase or Rational 
ClearCase LT client software must be installed. Once Rational ClearCase has 
been installed, Rational Application Developer must then connect to Rational 
ClearCase in order to enable Rational ClearCase operations within the IDE. 
You can do this by selecting the Connect to Rational ClearCase icon in the 
Rational Application Developer toolbar, as shown in Figure 1. 

Figure 1: IBM Rational ClearCase access from IBM 

Rational Application Developer for WebSphere 

Software

After Rational Application Developer is connected to Rational ClearCase, 
Rational ClearCase functions can be accessed in several ways: through the 
Rational ClearCase pull-down menu; by selecting a file, right-clicking and 
selecting the Team option from the context menu; or by clicking on icons on the 
Rational ClearCase toolbar.

Page 12

The Rational ClearCase pull-down menu, shown in Figure 1, enables 
Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software users to perform 
specific Rational ClearCase operations from within the Rational Application 
Developer workspace. If using Rational ClearCase LT, items only supported in 
Rational ClearCase but not in Rational ClearCase LT will be disabled. Rational 
Application Developer for WebSphere Software users must upgrade to Rational 
ClearCase to access these functions. 

The Rational ClearCase toolbar, also shown in Figure 1, is used to perform 
frequently used Rational ClearCase functions. Developers can quickly and 
easily perform Rational ClearCase and UCM functions through a simple mouse 
click from within the Rational Application Developer workspace. 

Figure 2: IBM Rational ClearCase access from the 

Team Context menu 

The Rational ClearCase Team option on the context menu, shown in Figure 2, 
provides another method of accessing Rational ClearCase functions directly 
from Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software. Note that many 
functions, such as source control operations, are available on common project 
files through the Rational ClearCase pull-down menu, Rational ClearCase 
toolbar and Team option on the context menu.

developers to work from home or other remote locations using broadband or 
dial-up connections.  Rational ClearCase provides software asset management 
features that make it easy for development teams to work with resources 
in a shared repository regardless of where team members are located. The 
Rational ClearCase Remote Client feature allows developers to access Rational 
ClearCase from a variety of network connections, including broadband (WAN) 
and dial-up, in addition to traditional local area networks (LANs), using an 
HTTP(s) connection to a Rational ClearCase Web server.

Best practices 
Having a good tool is one thing; using it effectively is another. Seven areas 
of best practices are identified for using Rational ClearCase and Rational 
ClearQuest with Rational Developer products or Eclipse. These best practices 
have been gleaned from vast experience working with these products and can 
help you enable more efficient development. 

Isolate subsystems or architectural layers into separate components 
A component-based architecture helps promote software reuse and sharing 
among applications. In a Java or J2EE application, a good candidate for a 
component is any logical grouping of files that need to be baselined and 
released independently or that are shared by multiple applications. For 
example, a Rational Application Developer project that produces several Java 
archive (JAR) files that are shared among many applications may be a good 
candidate for a component. With UCM, these components can be baselined 
independently and shared among multiple UCM projects. UCM components 
should not be confused with fine-grained Java artifacts, such as classes, 
packages, JARs and enterprise archive files (EARs), which do not necessarily 
constitute UCM components by themselves. Creating UCM components for 
such fine-grained artifacts may lead to an unnecessarily large number of 
components.

Perform version control for necessary files only 
Source files are generally versioned and shared with other project team 
members, while files that have been built in a developer’s private stream are 
typically not intended to be shared with the entire team. Users must ensure 
that the right files are versioned; a user may not want to version and share 
compiled files (ex: .class files) and build settings, but may wish to version and 
share source files. Rational Developer products provide an option for ignoring 
specific file types that you do not wish to add to source control. The Rational 
ClearCase integration adds a default list of file types to this list of ignored 
resources. See the Rational Developer products help for more information on 
ignored resources. 

Improve developer productivity with 
IBM Rational ClearCase and IBM Rational ClearQuest
Page 20

Use a staging area for versioning deployed assets 
Although files that have been built in a private development stream are not 
typically shared, it is a good practice to perform version control on built 
artifacts that will be deployed as part of an application once a stable baseline 
of that application has been produced.  This is typically done in a staging area 
VOB whose structure often reflects the structure of the deployed application.

Use a separate Rational Developer workspace for each ClearCase view 
Often, developers work with multiple Rational ClearCase views to access 
different versions of the same Rational Developer project, and these views must 
be accessible from the Rational Developer workspace. It is recommended that 
you associate one Rational ClearCase view with a unique Rational Developer 
workspace. For example, if you want to work in a parallel-development 
environment where you have a development view A for bug fixes to release 
A and another development view B for release B of the same application, 
you should use two different Rational Developer workspaces—one for view A 
and one for view B. This makes it easy to switch among different versions of 
the same Rational Developer project by simply opening another workspace 
associated with the necessary Rational ClearCase view. It is also a good practice 
to use the same name for the workspace as the Rational ClearCase view it is 
associated with. To switch from one workspace to another, select File > Switch 
Workspace from the main Rational Developer menu and select the desired 
workspace.  

Create a standardized development environment 
It is important that all project team members share a common development 
environment to help ensure consistency and reduce integration problems 
typically related to inconsistent build settings or other configuration problems. 
One way to help avoid these problems is by sharing common configuration 
information with simple projects. Simple projects can be used to store common

project artifacts, such as getting-started instructions, build instructions and 
guidelines for team preference settings. Sharing this information can save 
developers time by providing consistent workspaces, build settings and other 
environment settings. 

Use Team Project Sets to define consistent lineups of Rational Developer projects 
Team Project Sets specify a list of Rational Developer product projects that are 
under version control, which can then be quickly imported all at once. Using 
Team Project Sets saves time for developers because they do not have to import 
individual projects. They are also free from having to understand project 
dependencies and they can ensure consistency within each workspace. 

Add third-party libraries to source control 
To help eliminate dependencies on local build environments and 
incompatibilities between JAR versions, third-party JAR libraries should be 
placed under version control. Rational Developer product projects can then 
reference these third-party libraries as external JARs, allowing team members 
to have a common class path because the JAR files are stored in a single, 
common location under version control.

Summary 
Software developers face significant challenges, including increasing software 
complexity, increasing development environment complexity, mounting 
time-to-market pressure and higher software quality expectations. Software 
configuration management can help reduce or eliminate these challenges. 

IBM Rational ClearCase and IBM Rational ClearQuest are proven SCM 
solutions that manage change and complexity. Going well beyond version 
control, they provide advanced capabilities that enable parallel development, 
promote reuse, support large distributed teams, reduce build/release cycle 
times, minimize downtime and reduce risk. 

Rational ClearCase and Rational ClearQuest are seamlessly integrated with 
IBM Rational Developer products and the open source Eclipse framework. This 
deep integration enables a wide array of SCM operations to be performed directly 
from within the Rational IDEs and Eclipse framework. By combining these 
popular Java and J2EE IDEs with industry-leading SCM solutions, IBM delivers 
everything that developers need to work effectively in a team environment 
without requiring them to leave their IDE. The result can be dramatically 
increased productivity, improved quality and maximum business value.
