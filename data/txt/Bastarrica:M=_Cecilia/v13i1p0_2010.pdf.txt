This special issue of the CLEI Electronic Journal consists of extended and revised versions of articles presented at 
the 2nd International Workshop on Advances Software Engineering (IWASE’2009), which took place in Santiago, 
Chile, in November 2009 concurrently with the International Conference of the Chilean Computer Science Society 
(SCCC'2009). 

We  received  18  submissions  (from  Chile,  Argentina,  Brazil  and  Uruguay),  and  9  of  them  were  selected  for 
presentation  by  a  12-member  Program  Committee  composed  by  researchers  from  Chile,  Argentina,  Brazil  and 
Spain. All 9 articles were presented by one of its authors, and 8 of them were revised and extended for this special 
issue. 

Half of the selected articles dealt with modeling and improvement of software development processes: 

•  Paper 1, by Schwening and Thiry, describes a method to define Process Capability Profiles for Very Small 

Software Enterprises; 

•  Paper  2,  by  Villarroel,  Gómez,  Gajardo  y  Rodríguez,  presents  a  process  improvement  case  study  that 

combined the Competisoft framework and the Tutelkan platform; 

•  Paper  3,  by  Salviano,    Martinez,  Zoucas  and  Thiry,  addresses  the  engineering  of  Process  Capability 

Models; 

•  Paper  4,  by  Thiry,  Zoucas  and  Tristao,  proposes  a  mapping  from  process  capability  models  to  support 

processes assessments. 

Two articles addressed empirical issues of software development: 

•  Paper 5, by Fuenzalida and Antillanca, concerns the synchrony of interactions in uses cases;  

•  Paper  6,  bySagredo,  Becerra  and  Valdés,  presents  an  experimental  evaluation  of  approaches  for  software 

systems composition. 

Finally,  two  articles  offered  contributions  to  the  foundations  of  the  software  engineering  discipline,  and  make  for 
more formal reading: 

•  Paper 7, by Pons, Giandini, Pérez and Baum, describe a calculus to compose hybrid QVT transformations; 

•  Paper 8, by Vignaga, proposes to use a type model and transformations to manage models. 

We hope these articles will be valuable contributions to the development of software engineering in Latin America.  
Happy reading.
