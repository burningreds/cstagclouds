Abstract. The Semantic Web is the initiative of the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C) to make information on the Web readable not only
by humans but also by machines. RDF is the data model for Semantic 
Web data, and SPARQL is the query language for this data model.
RDF and SPARQL are the output of long standardizations processes
led by the W3C. These processes, usually in charge of developers, are
not always open to consider researchers opinions on the theoretical implications 
of the design decisions in terms of computational complexity,
logical expressiveness, etc. In this tutorial, we survey some of the key
aspects of SPARQL and RDF from a database perspective. We put emphasis 
on the experience of our Database Theory group (at PUC-Chile
and UChile) dealing with W3C standardization processes, and how the
work of this group has been inﬂuential not only in the theory but also in
the practice of RDF and SPARQL. We focus on the normative semantics
of SPARQL 1.0, that follows closely the proposal of our group, we introduce 
some navigational extensions for the language, and we discuss on
the interplay between SPARQL and Open Linked Data. We also present
some important recently published issues that we have discovered in the
upcoming SPARQL 1.1 speciﬁcation that may severely impact on the
adoption of the new standard.

and Sebastián Conca from PUC-Chile, and Claudio Gutierrez from Universidad de
Chile.
