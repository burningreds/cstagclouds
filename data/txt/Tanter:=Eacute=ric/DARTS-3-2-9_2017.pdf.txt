Abstract

This artifact is a web interpreter for the ObSec
language deﬁned in the companion paper. ObSec
is a simple object-oriented language that supports
type-based declassiﬁcation. Type-base declassiﬁcation 
exploits the familiar notion of type abstraction
to support expressive declassiﬁcation policies in a
simple and expressive manner.

Scope

1
The artifact is designed to test the semantics of the ObSec language described in companion paper,
allowing users to deﬁne their own declassiﬁcation policies.

Content

2
The artifact package includes:

a Virtual Box Linux machine.
a .zip ﬁle including the binaries of the ObSec interpreter.
detailed instructions for using the artifact provided as an readme.pdf ﬁle.
To simplify the access, we provide an online ObSec Pad at https://pleiad.cl/obsec/ which
does not require any installation and is always up-to-date. If you want to use an snapshot of the
state of the interpreter (at the submission time), then follow the instructions in the readme.pdf
ﬁle to use either the Virtual Box machine or the ObSec interpreter binaries.
