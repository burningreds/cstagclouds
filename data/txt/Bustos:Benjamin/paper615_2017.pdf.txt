Abstract. IMGpedia is a linked dataset that provides a public SPARQL
endpoint where users can answer queries that combine the visual similarity
of images from Wikimedia Commons and semantic information from existing 
knowledge-bases. Our demo will show example queries that capture the
potential of the current data stored in IMGpedia. We also plan to discuss
potential use-cases for the dataset and ways in which we can improve the
quality of the information it captures and the expressiveness of its queries.

Introduction

Wikimedia Commons1 is a large-scale dataset that contains about 30 million
freely usable media ﬁles (image, audio and video), many of which are used within
Wikipedia articles and galleries; it also contains meta-data about each ﬁle, such as
its author, licensing, and the articles where the ﬁle is used. Using this information,
DBpedia Commons [5] automatically extracts the meta-data of the media ﬁles of
Wikimedia Commons pages and presents the resulting corpus as a linked dataset.
To compliment DBpedia Commons, we have created IMGpedia [2]: a linked
dataset that contains diﬀerent feature descriptors for 14.8 million images from the
Wikimedia Commons. IMGpedia also provides similarity relations among the
images, as well as references to DBpedia [3] if the image is used on a Wikipedia
article of the entity. This dataset thus enables people to perform visuo-semantic
queries, that is, queries that combine image similarity and semantic criteria.

We ﬁrst introduce IMGpedia. We then show examples of queries that IMGpedia 
supports, as will be shown in the demo session. Finally we address the challenges
and the future directions of the project, which we also plan to discuss in the session.

IMGpedia

IMGpedia is a linked dataset [2] that contains three diﬀerent visual descriptors for
each of the 14.8 million images of Wikimedia Commons. These descriptors capture
the following features of each image as high-dimensional vectors: brightness distribution,
 border orientations and color layout. IMGpedia provides static similarity
relations among the images: for each image and for each descriptor, the dataset
contains the 10 nearest neighbors—that is, the 10 most similar images according to
how close they are in the Manhattan distance between their descriptors.

This information is described in RDF using a custom vocabulary that combines
novel terms with terms from established vocabularies and appropriate RDFS/OWL
deﬁnitions (see our extended paper accepted for the ISWC Resources Track for

1 http://commons.wikimedia.org

more details [2]). Additionaly, IMGpedia contains links to DBpedia entities and
to DBpedia Commons in order to obtain further metadata related to the image.
Currently we provide ∼12 million links to DBpedia: an image is linked to an entity
if the image appears in the Wikipedia article of which the entity is about.

IMGpedia is publicly available as an RDF dump2 and as a SPARQL endpoint3.

3 Visuo-semantic Queries

Using SPARQL federation over the IMGpedia and DBpedia datasets, we are able
to answer visuo-semantic queries—that is, queries that combine visual similarity
(e.g. images similar to a given picture of La Moneda Palace, in Santiago) with
queries about semantic facts (e.g. obtain a list of governmental palaces in Europe).
Hence, an example of a visuo-semantic query would be to obtain the depictions of
the European governmental palaces that are similar to La Moneda Palace. In this
section we show some examples of queries that can be answered using IMGpedia.
First, IMGpedia can answer image similarity queries, since it provides static
similarity relations among them. In our extended paper [2], an example of this kind
of query – looking for images similar to one of Hopsten Marktplatz in Germany –
and the respective results can be found.

We can also perform semantic image retrieval4. In Listing 1 we request the
images of the paintings made in the 16th century that are currently being displayed
at the Louvre. In Figure 1 we show the results.

Listing 1: Query to retrieve images of paintings from the 16th century that are
displayed at the Louvre.

SELECT ? url ? label WHERE {

SERVICE < http :// dbpedia . org / sparql > {

? res a yago : Wikicat16th - c e n t u r y P a i n t i n g s ;

dcterms : subject dbc : P a i n t i n g s _ o f _ t h e _ L o u v r e ; rdfs : label ? label .

FILTER ( LANG (? label )= ’ en ’)

}
? img imo : a p p e a r s I n ? res ; imo : fileURL ? url . }

Finally, IMGpedia can answer visuo-semantic queries. In our extended paper [2]
we show a visuo-semantic query that requests the images of museums that are
similar to any image of an European cathedral on Wikipedia. In Listing 2 we show
a SPARQL query that requests the museums that are similar to images that appear
on articles categorized as Roman Catholic cathedrals in Europe, using the property
path dcterms:subject/skos:broader* to navigate sub-categories. In Figure 2 we
show a sample of the retrieved results.

Listing 2: Federated visuo-semantic query requesting images of museums that are
similar to images related to European cathedrals

SELECT

D I S T I N C T ? urls ? urlt WHERE {

SERVICE < http :// dbpedia . org / sparql > {

? sres dcterms : subject / skos : broader * dbc : R o m a n _ C a t h o l i c _ c a t h e d r a l s _ i n _ E u r o p e }

4 Future Extensions

IMGpedia is a novel resource. We plan to demo the ﬁrst release of the dataset by
showing the diﬀerent kinds of queries that it is able to answer. However, we also
wish to discuss plans to extend and improve the dataset and are interested to collect
feedback from the ISWC community.5 We are currently working on the following
tasks towards improving the quality and usability of the data:

for feedback, feature requests, suggestions, etc.

for some visuo-semantic queries. We are interested in creating links with Wikidata 
[6] to see if this would enable new/better visuo-semantic queries.

– Compare similarity methods: IMGpedia was built using FLANN [4] to
compute the similarity relations. However, other approximated algorithms or
indexing techniques can be used. Hence we are studying and comparing the
diﬀerent ways to provide the similarity links.

– Include modern descriptors: The visual descriptors used in IMGpedia are
rather classic techniques. We want to explore how image similarity would behave
using more modern descriptors. One such descriptor is DeCAF7 [1], which is
based on the neural network classiﬁcation of the image.

– Explore more relations among images: IMGpedia currently only provides
similarity relations between images. We will explore of there are other relations
that are worth including, such as contains if one image forms part of another,
or sameObject if two images capture the same object but with diﬀerent perspectives 
or scales.

– Provide user-interfaces: Currently IMGpedia can be accessed through a
dump, a SPARQL endpoint, or through dereferencing Linked Data IRIs. We
also plan to investigate interfaces that will help users interact more intuitively
with the IMGpedia dataset.

Aside from extensions and improvements to IMGpedia, we are interested to
ﬁnd additional use-cases for the dataset. We believe that many applications can
be built upon IMGpedia. We can use pre-trained neural networks to classify the
dataset’s images and provide the results as further context. We can also train our
own network using the classes or categories of the related DBpedia/Wikidata
resources to label the images and see if these provide an improved classiﬁcation.
More generally, we hope that IMGpedia may become a test-bed dataset for further
works in the intersection of the Semantic Web and Multimedia.
