ABSTRACT
In this article we explore the behavior of Twitter users under an
emergency situation. In particular, we analyze the activity related to
the 2010 earthquake in Chile and characterize Twitter in the hours
and days following this disaster. Furthermore, we perform a preliminary 
study of certain social phenomenons, such as the dissemination 
of false rumors and conﬁrmed news. We analyze how this
information propagated through the Twitter network, with the purpose 
of assessing the reliability of Twitter as an information source
under extreme circumstances. Our analysis shows that the propagation 
of tweets that correspond to rumors differs from tweets that
spread news because rumors tend to be questioned more than news
by the Twitter community. This result shows that it is posible to
detect rumors by using aggregate analysis on tweets.

INTRODUCTION

Twitter is a micro-blogging service that brings together millions
of users. Allowing its users to publish and exchange short messages,
 also known as tweets, through a wide variety of clients.
Users can post their tweets by sending e-mails, SMS text-messages,
directly from their smartphones and a wide array of Web-based services.
 Also, Twitter enables real-time propagation of information
to a large group of users. This makes it an ideal environment for
the dissemination of breaking-news directly from the news source
and/or geographical point of interest. Twitter has been found to

be useful for emergency response and recovery e.g. [12]. Nevertheless,
 as we observe in this study, Twitter not only enables the
effective broadcasting of valid news, but also of baseless rumors.

In this paper we examine how Twitter is used during a particular
emergency situation. Our main focus is to characterize Twitter as
an information source during this crisis. First, we present general
characteristics of the post-quake Chilean Twitter community, which
conﬁrms some results observed in related work and extends existing 
research. Second, we focus on the issue of veracity. Based on
anecdotal evidence, we observed that false rumors spread quickly
contributing to general chaos in the absence of ﬁrst-hand information 
from traditional sources. Motivated by this ﬁnding, our work
seeks to contribute towards a deeper understanding of valid news
and baseless rumors during a disaster. Additionally, we believe
that some of our ﬁndings can be applied to some extent to other
types of phenomenons, such as non-critical situations in which no
a priori reliable information source is available.

The Chilean earthquake of 2010. The earthquake occurred off
the coast of the Maule region of Chile, on Saturday, February 27,
2010 at 06:34:14 UTC (03:34:14 local time). It reached a magnitude 
of 8.8 on the Richter scale and lasted for 90 seconds; it is
considered the seventh stronger earthquake ever recorded in history1.
 A few minutes after the earthquake, a tsunami hit the Chilean
shores. Nearly 500 people were reported dead after the disaster and
more than 2 million people were affected in some way.

In the hours and days after this earthquake, Twitter was used to
tweet time-critical information about tsunami alerts, missing people,
 deceased people, available services, interrupted services, road
conditions, functioning gas stations, among other emerging topics 
related to the catastrophe. The earthquake reached the level
of trending-topic in Twitter a few hours after the event. Figure 1
shows Twitter activity related to the hash-tag #terremotochile
(chileearthquake) during a period of 10 days after the event 2. Nevertheless,
 it should be noted that due to infrastructure issues, telecommunications 
(including Internet) were intermittent in Chile for
the ﬁrst 48 hours after the quake. 3 The ﬁrst tweets from Chile with
information of the event were only observed around 3:56 AM (local
time). This meant that tweet frequency originated from Chile was
much lower than expected due to the circumstances.Therefore, during 
times when bursts of activity would have been expected (right
after the quake), the number of tweets dropped considerably and
did not recover completely in the next 48 hours.

Research questions. To analyze the impact of Twitter on the propagation 
of information during the Chilean earthquake, we perform
two types of studies over post-quake tweet data: (i) We characterize 
the usage and social networks of the days immediately after the
event. The goal of this task is to observe how rumors and news are
propagated and the dynamics of the followers/followees relationship.
 Also, we look at how the most authoritative users inﬂuence
topics discussed in the network and how terms in tweets are correlated,
 among other things. (ii) We investigate the ability of the
social network to discriminate between false rumors and conﬁrmed
news. To do this we examine tweets related to conﬁrmed news and
to rumors, classifying manually each tweet. The aim of this task
is to measure if and how the network ﬁlters false information from
accurate news.

Our contributions. First, we characterized at a local level Twitter
data related to a recent natural disaster. Second, we study Twitter
as an environment for the quick propagation of real and ﬁctional
news and ﬁnally we discuss how users behave in when faced with
these types of information.

Roadmap. The remaining of the work is organized as follows:
Section 2 presents an exploratory analysis of the data, focused on
the presentation of the dataset and the description of the social interactions 
and keywords used during the quake. Section 4 presents
an analysis of conﬁrmed news and false rumors obtained from a
human-assessment process. In Section 5 we discuss related work
and ﬁnally in Section 6 we show conclusions and future work.

2. THE TWITTER NETWORK DURING AN

EMERGENCY

2.1 Experimental Framework

To study how Twitter was used during the earthquake in Chile,
we collected user activity data (tweets, plus other user-related in-
formation) during the time window between February 27, 2010 and
March 2, 2010. To determine the set of tweets that were more or
less local, or closely related to the Chilean Twitter community, we
used a ﬁlter-based heuristic approach. This was necessary because
the data at our disposal from Twitter did not provide geographical
information about its users (there are no IP addresses or reliable location 
information in general). Therefore, we focused on the community 
that surrounded the topic of the earthquake. For this we
selected all tweets using the Santiago timezone, plus tweets which
included a set of keywords (using background knowledge from the
authors) which characterized the event. These keywords included

Figure 2: Twitter activity (local time)

hash-tags such as #terremotochile and the names of the affected 
geographic locations (all of them in Spanish). This preliminary 
selection indexed 4,727,524 tweets and 19.8% of these tweets
corresponded to replies to other tweets.

The activity for the entire collection is shown in Figure 2 and
shows the highest volume on the last day (when communications
were restored in most of the country).
2.2 The Social Network

The indexed tweets are related to 716,344 different users, which
registered an average of 1,018 followers (number of people following 
that person) and 227 followees (number of people a person
follows). A scatter plot of number of followers versus number of
followees is shown in Figure 3.

The plot shown in Figure 3 is in a logarithmic format in both
axes. The plot shows a great fraction of users registering less than
2,000 followees (friends). This phenomenon is due to the fact that
there is an upper limit on the number of people a user could follow.
 However, Twitter does not consider this constraint for users
who register more than 2,000 followers, being posible to follow the
same number of tweeters that registers as followers.

In the case of the followers count, this variable exhibits a considerable 
variance. It is common to observe that the number of followees 
is less than the number of followers. In fact, 355,343 users
registers more followers than followees (49.6%), 331,546 users
registers more followees than followers (46.2%) and only 29,455
users registers the same number of followers and followees (4.2%).
The number of authority users with more than 100,000 followers

Figure 3: Followers/followees scatter plot.

is only 633 and in general they are mostly politicians/celebrities or
mass media (e.g. CNN, The New York Times, Breaking News).

We count the number of tweets each user contributed around the
event in Table 1. Over 50% of the users contributed only 1 tweet.
On the other hand, only 11.47% of users tweet 10 or more tweets
during this period. The average number of tweets per user (6.59) is
above the median, indicating that there are outliers who tweet far
more than expected.

wers/followees.

We analyze the relation between the number of followers / followees 
and the number of tweets each user posts.
In Figure 4
we plot the average number of tweets against the number of fo-
llowers/followees.

As we can see in Figure 4, the average number of tweets per
number of followers/followees exhibits a wide variance in the range
[1, 104] which is also where the majority of the tweets are concentrated.
 The average number of tweets per number of followees is
greater than the average number of tweets per number of followers
in the range [1, 10], as opposed to the relation that exhibits the range
[10, 104]. We can also see that the number of tweets increases when
the number of followers and followees increases. In fact, when the
number of followers/followees is greater than 2,000 we can observe
that the number of tweets increases by one order of magnitude.

To investigate how the authority of a user inﬂuences the number
of tweets that it produces, we retrieve users which register most
tweets. We calculate the average number of followers/followees
for the top-k users who register more activity during the event. We
plot the k variable in the range [50,500]. The results are shown in
Figure 5.

Figure 5: Average number of followers/followees for the top
users.

As Figure 5 shows, for the top users the number of followers is
by two orders of magnitude higher than the number of followees.
In fact, the number of followees reaches an average close to 1,800,
while the average number of followers is more than 100,000. We
can observe also that when the number of tweets decreases, the
number of followers decreases. In fact, the top-50 most active users
register a signiﬁcant fraction of the followers in the network.

In Table 2 we show the top-10 most active users during the earthquake,
 ordered by the number of tweets they post. Eight out of
these ten users are associated to mass media outlets (either journalists 
of these organizations, or institutional accounts such as “CNN-
BreakingNews”). As we can see their number of followers is three
or four orders of magnitude larger than their number of followees.
We also investigated how these most active users relate to each
other. In Figure 6 (left) we show the followees graph for the top 20
most active users during the event. Each node represents a Twitter
user and each edge represents a relation is a follower of (friend).
The area of each node is proportional to the number of followers
each user registers. Figure 6 (left) shows that the social graph has
a strong connected component among these users. However, the

niﬁcant compared to the total number of users who posted tweets
during the event. In fact, the total number of tweets registered for
the top-10 trending-topics is only 20,322, which represents 35.52%
of the tweets posted by the top-10 most active users.

The analysis of the Twitter network during this crisis exhibits
similar results as prior work (see for example Kwak et al. [5],
where Twitter is not analyzed under emergencies/atypical situa-
tions). Therefore the characteristics of the network maintain their
properties in atypical situations. This is a static observations because 
in this ﬁrst approach, we did not measure how the network
evolved during the days of the earthquake.

3. TWITTER ACTIVITY DURING AN
EMERGENCY: THE EARTHQUAKE

In this section, we ﬁrst analyze Twitter activity in our post-quake
dataset. Then, we examine the nature of the information disseminated 
through Twitter during this critical event.

We analyze the variations in activity during the ﬁrst day after
the earthquake. Figure 7 shows the number of tweets registered
for this day which contained the word “earthquake” (“terremoto”
in Spanish). The impact of the event was very high the ﬁrst day,
measured in the number of tweets shown in Figure 7. Tweets containing 
the term “earthquake” register two peaks in activity, the ﬁrst
one a few moments after the quake, and the second one at 1:00 p.m.
(local time). It should be noted that a large portion of tweets were
affected by Internet interruptions during this day.

As mentioned before, the impact of the quake also affects trendingtopics.
 Figure 8 shows Twitter activity for two trending-topics. The
ﬁrst one, identiﬁed with the “Viña del Mar Festival” label corresfar 
left side of the graph) is followed by only two top users, and
it does not register any is a follower of relationship in the top-20.
In the social graph of our entire collection this authority follows
28 users but it is followed by 2,930,769. 11 of the 20 most active
users correspond to mass media organizations or celebrities related
to mass media. The rest of the top-20 belong to other types of
organizations, such as non-proﬁts, and the also register few friends
(users that they follow or followees).

We also illustrate the activity of each of the top-20 users during
the quake. In Figure 6 (right) shows the same relationship as Figure 
6 (left) but in this case the size of each node represents the
number of tweets of the user. As Figure 6 (right) shows, followees
relationships are closely related to the number of tweets each user
posted during the event. Users with most activity are more connected 
among each other. In particular, the most connected component 
of the followees graph represents the Chilean news media
that is strongly inﬂuenced by the event. It is not the case of the
most authoritative users, like CNN, which are located on the border 
of the graph because they register activity also in other topics.
Thus, observing only activity related to the earthquake, the connected 
component of news media concentrates a signiﬁcant fraction
of the tweets during the event.

The most active trending-topics related to the earthquake are
shown in Table 3. This table also shows the number of tweets each
trend registers and the number of users who contributed at least one
tweet to the trend. As Table 3 shows, the most popular trendingtopic 
is identiﬁed with the #terremotochile hash-tag.
It registers
close to 10,000 tweets during the event, posted by more than 4,000
users. All topics are about the Chilean earthquake. However, the
fraction of users who contributed to a trending-topic is not very sigIn 
Figure 9 we show the re-tweet graphs that emerge in the ﬁrst
hour post-quake. In order to illustrate how the propagation process
works over the Twitter social network we plot the graphs considering 
intervals of 15 minutes.

Figure 9 shows that tweets with the term “earthquake” are quickly
propagated through the social network.
In fact, we observe that
only thirty minutes after the quake some re-tweet graphs exhibit interesting 
patterns. In some cases tweet propagation takes the form
of a tree. This is the case of direct quoting of information. And in
other cases the propagation graph presents cycles, which indicates
that the information is being commented and replied, as it is passed
on. This last case involves reciprocity in the information dissemination 
process. The biggest subgraph is shown in Figure 9(d) and
it displays 6 degrees of separation. The remaining subgraphs have
less than 6 degrees of separation. Finally we can observe that a
signiﬁcant fraction of the subgraphs has only one or two edges.
Tweet vocabulary. We analyze the vocabulary of tweets in this crisis 
situation. Intuitively, we expect a signiﬁcant amount of tweets to
contain terms related to the earthquake. Therefore, we also expect
a high correlation of terms used in the collection.

To illustrate the properties of the Twitter vocabulary during the
Chilean earthquake, we retrieve the top-50 most used terms each
day. Then we count the number of occurrences of these terms in
tweets. In this analysis, the vocabulary of terms has been processed
to eliminate accents, digits and punctuation. Moreover, stopwords
found in the collection have also been eliminated.

We plot term collections as term clouds. The size of each term is
proportional to the number of occurrences each term registers in our
dataset. The terms have been translated from Spanish to English.
Term clouds are plotted in Figure 10.

Figure 10(a) shows the term cloud for the ﬁrst day of the event.
As the term cloud shows, the most signiﬁcant terms are “tsunami”
and “deceased”. Thus, these terms illustrate the focus of tweets for
the ﬁrst day: the tsunami which hit the shores of Chile minutes after 
the quake, and the death toll count. In Figure 10(b) we show
the term cloud for the second day of the catastrophe. In this day
topics are focused on “missing people”, as a consequence of the
earthquake and the tsunami of the previous day. Terms as “list” or
“favor” indicate that tweets are focused on asking for help to locate
missing people. In Figure 10(c) we show the term cloud for the
third day of the event. As in the previous day, people are looking
for help to locate missing people. Popular terms are “help”, “peo-
ple”, “favor” and “people ﬁnder”. Another term used this day was
“Concepcion”, the name of a city located very close to the epicenter 
of the quake. Finally, Figure 10(d) shows the term cloud for
the fourth day of the event. Some terms are related to the need of
ﬁnding people, such as “help”. But another trending-topic emerges
this day. A NASA report released this day claims that in addition 
to causing widespread death and destruction, the earthquake
may have shifted the Earth’s axis permanently and created shorter
days4. Thus, tweets where terms as “Earth” and “axis” became very
popular after the fourth day.

4. FALSE RUMOR PROPAGATION

In this section we conduct a case study to test the veracity of information 
on Twitter and how this information is spread through
the social network. To achieve this task, we manually selected
some relevant cases of valid news items, which were conﬁrmed
at some point by reliable sources. We refer to these cases as conﬁrmed 
truths. Additionally, we manually selected important cases
4Based on calculations thus far, every day should be 1.26 microseconds

quake” (Feb. 27, local time).

ponds to a local music festival that normally gathers the attention
of most local media during the studied time window. The second
trending-topic, identiﬁed with the “Chilean earthquake” label, corresponds 
to the emerging earthquake trend hash-tag.

As Figure 8 shows, the “Viña del Mar Festival” trend decays
quickly just a few moments after the quake. Moreover, the activity
of this topic is reduced to zero just twenty minutes after the quake.
On the other hand, the “Chilean earthquake” trend increases significantly 
in the ﬁrst two hours after the quake. These results suggest,
as we can expect, that the Twitter activity is proportional to the
signiﬁcance of the event.

We illustrate the impact of the quake by measuring the re-tweet
activity during the ﬁrst hours. A re-tweet (RT) is a quote of another 
tweet, which may or may not include a comment or reply.
However, most re-tweets posted by a user are of tweets originally
posted by one of its followees (which can also be re-tweets). Therefore,
 re-tweet activity reﬂects how the social network helps in the
propagation of the information. An active social network facilitates
the quick dissemination of relevant tweets. In certain way, when a
user reads a tweet and re-tweets this to other users, it determines
the importance of the original tweet. As a collective phenomenon,
how deep re-tweets cover the social graph indicates the relevance
of the tweet for the community.

of baseless rumors which emerged during the crisis (conﬁrmed to
be false at some point). We refer to these cases as false rumors. Our
goal is to observe if users interact in a different manner when faced
with these types of information. Each case studied was selected
according to the following criteria:

1. A signiﬁcant volume of tweets is related to the case (close to

1, 000 or more).

2. Reliable sources (external to Twitter) allow to asses if the

claim is true or false.

The following step was to create a list of 7 conﬁrmed truths and
7 false rumors. This list was obtained by manually analyzing samples 
of tweets and also using ﬁrst-hand background knowledge of
the crisis. For example, a true news item (conﬁrmed truth) was
the occurrence of a tsunami in the locations of Iloca and Duao. In
fact this information was quickly informed through Twitter sources
while government authorities ignored its existence. On the other
hand, a baseless rumor was the death of locally famous artist Ricardo 
Arjona. In each case we collected between 42 and 700 unique
tweets for classiﬁcation (identical re-tweets were discarded for classiﬁcation 
purposes). These tweets were retrieved by querying the
collection using keywords related to each true or false case. The
next step was to classify tweets into the following categories: afﬁrms 
(propagates information conﬁrming the item), denies (refutes
the information item), questions (asks about the information item),

and unrelated or unknown. We automatically propagated labels in
such a way that all identical re-tweets of a tweet get the same label.
The results of the classiﬁcation are shown in Table 4.

The classiﬁcation results (see Table 4) shows that a large percentage 
(95.5% approx.) of tweets related to conﬁrmed truths validate 
the information (“afﬁrms” category label). The percentage of
tweets that deny these true cases is very low, only 0.3%. On the
other hand, we observe that the number of tweets that deny information 
becomes much larger when the information corresponds to
a false rumor. In fact, this category concentrates around 50% of
tweets. There are also more tweets in the “questions” category in
the case of false rumors. This information is shown in Figure 11.

These results show that the propagation of tweets that correspond
to rumors differs from tweets that spread news because rumors tend
to be questioned more than news by the Twitter community. Notice 
that this fact suggests that the Twitter community works like a
collaborative ﬁlter of information. This result suggests also a very
promising research line: it could posible to detect rumors by using
aggregate analysis on tweets.

Twitter in emergency events According to the widely used taxonomy 
of Powell and Rayner [9] (cited e.g. in [6, 7]) there are several

stages in a disaster: 1) warning, 2) threat, 3) impact, 4) inventory, 5)
rescue, 6) remedy, and 7) recovery. Most studies of microblogging
during emergencies, including this one, focus on the stages 3 to 5
according to this taxonomy. These are the stages at which more traIn 
the speciﬁc case of the Chilean earthquake of 2010 discussed
in this study, bloggers have published ﬁrst-hand accounts on how
they used twitter during the emergency8.

6. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we presented a study of Twitter during an emergency 
situation: the recent 2010 earthquake in Chile. First, we analyzed 
and characterized the social network of the community surrounding 
the topic. This analysis conﬁrmed that network topology
characteristics remained unchanged regarding studies performed
under normal circumstances (see for example the recent paper of
Kwak et al. [5]). On the other hand we show new interesting insights 
on how trending-topics behave in this situation and how they
propagate. Therefore, our ﬁndings on a more or less local network
present no loss of generality for larger communities. Another interesting 
insight is that the vocabulary used in crisis situations exhibits
a low variance. This fact indicates that tweets tend to describe a
common/global topic, diminishing the network entropy.

Second, we focused on the propagation of conﬁrmed truths and
false rumors on Twitter. Our results, on a small set of cases, indicate 
that false rumors tend to be questioned much more than conﬁrmed 
truths, which we consider a very positive result. As an application,
 given that detecting when a tweet is asking for information
should be possible to do with state-of-the-art text classiﬁers, microblogging 
platforms could for instance warn people that many
other users are questioning the information item they are reading.
This would provide signals for users to determine how much to
trust a certain piece of information.

Some of the ﬁrst accounts of the use of Twitter during emergency 
events appeared in Wired on October 20075 in relation to the
wildﬁres in Southern California. Journalists hailed the immediacy
of the service which allowed to report breaking news quickly – in
many cases, more frequently than most mainstream media outlets.
Kireyev et al. [4] studied Twitter during two earthquakes in American 
Samoa and Sumatra that overlapped in time (both on September 
30th 2009), with an emphasis on studying how to use topic
modeling on the content of the tweets. Earle et al.[2] from the US
Geological Survey reported they started to correlate tweets with
seismic data to improve emergency response in late 20096.
In
early 2010 researcher Markus Strohmaier coined the term “Twicalli
scale” as a description of Twitter’s response to recent earthquakes
in California and Haiti7.

Hughes and Palen have described the use of Twitter during emergencies 
such as hurricanes and mass convergence events such as
political-party conventions [3]. Among other ﬁndings, they observe 
that the fraction of reply –preﬁxed by “@”– tweets is lower
during these events (6-8% vs. 22% normally); that the percentage
of tweets that include a URL is higher (40-50% vs. 25% normally);
and that users that start using twitter during an event tend to adopt
twitter afterwards.

Longueville et al. [1] describe the use of Twitter during a forest
ﬁre close to Marseille in mid-2009, they identiﬁed different types
of twitter users: those related to mass media outlets, those acting
as aggregators of information, and normal citizens. Sarah Vieweg
and collaborators have studied extensively the use of Twitter for
situational awareness during emergency situations such as ﬂoods
and grassﬁres; see [12, 13, 11] and references therein.
