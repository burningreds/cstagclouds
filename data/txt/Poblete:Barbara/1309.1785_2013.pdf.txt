Abstract

Online social networks are known to be demographically biased. Currently there are
questions about what degree of representativity of the physical population they have, and
how population biases impact user-generated content. In this paper we focus on centralism,
a problem aﬀecting Chile. Assuming that local diﬀerences exist in a country, in terms of
vocabulary, we built a methodology based on the vector space model to ﬁnd distinctive content
from diﬀerent locations, and use it to create classiﬁers to predict whether the content of a
micro-post is related to a particular location, having in mind a geographically diverse selection
of micro-posts. We evaluate them in a case study where we analyze the virtual population of
Chile that participated in the Twitter social network during an event of national relevance:
the municipal (local governments) elections held in 2012. We observe that the participating
virtual population is spatially representative of the physical population, implying that there is
centralism in Twitter. Our classiﬁers out-perform a non geographically-diverse baseline at
the regional level, and have the same accuracy at a provincial level. However, our approach
makes assumptions that need to be tested in multi-thematic and more general datasets. We
leave this for future work.

Introduction

Chile is known as a country with a high participation of its population in social networks on
Internet: it has the highest penetration of Facebook1 in Latin America [3]. Undoubtedly, this
active presence in social networks has changed the way people communicate and how media and
government relate with people. For instance, media outlets use social media to interact with people
and ﬁnd out what their interests and opinions on a certain topic are. Although Facebook is the
social network with most penetration in Chile, another social network, Twitter 2, has much more
presence in the public sphere, given its public nature. Conversations and micro-posts, also called
tweets, are inherently public (although it is possible to make them private, only a small fraction of
accounts use this option). Therefore, to browse the content published in Twitter an account is not

needed, and a search by keywords or topics, annotated through hashtags, is all anyone needs to be
able to stay up-to-date with respect to what is trending at that moment.

However, in the physical world, Chile is becoming more centralized everyday [16], and it is
not clear if the virtual population present in Twitter reﬂects or is representative of the physical
population, and to what degree this virtual population is also centralized. A common saying is
“Santiago is not Chile”3, referring to the fact that the capital is not representative of the country,
yet media outlets concentrate in Santiago and government policies are tailored at the needs of
Santiago. Given the climatic, geographical and cultural diversity of Chile, centralism is a serious
problem. One example is that the law that dictates minimum housing requirements is the same
for all regions of the country [1], in spite of the extreme weather diﬀerences between northern and
southern regions.

Previous literature regarding this subject states that more populated cities are over-represented
in Twitter, while less populated cities are under-represented [11]. Because of over-representation of
populated places, in addition to the lack of balance in physical population distribution in Chile,
content from or about non largely populated locations is lost in the timeline of tweets. In addition,
it is hard to ﬁnd local content, as the only salient ways to ﬁnd content are to click on trending
topics, which by deﬁnition are biased towards more populated cities, and by searching. But this
implies that the information seeker already knows what to look for, if an information need eﬀectively
exists. As such, there is no current way to explore a geographically diverse timeline: users have the
responsibility to follow diverse accounts. However, current interfaces do not allow users to see a
diversity of tweets according to any criteria. Since Twitter recommends users (the “who to follow”
functionality) and tweets (the “discover” tab) based on account connections and activity. Users
who do not have diverse connections will not receive diverse recommendations.

Motivated by the situation described, in this paper we propose a methodology to address the

following research questions:

• Q1: Does the participating virtual population (in an event in Twitter) represent the physical

population, and to what degree?

• Q2: Given the content generated by the virtual population, is it possible to identify local

content using a lexical approach?

Our work presents the following contributions: 1) based on the vector space model, we build
language models and classiﬁers that, given a small text, such as a tweet, predict the location the
text is talking about. This is a diﬀerent approach from previous work that focused on classifying
the location of users; 2) a case study of the virtual population of Chile in Twitter. In particular, we
address the virtual population that participated in a national event of high local importance: the
municipal elections which took place in Chile in October 28th, 2012 [17]. We apply our methodology
in this dataset and evaluate our classiﬁers.

We discuss and conclude that, having characterized the participating virtual population in the
event, its distribution reﬂects the distribution of the physical population of Chile, and we ﬁnd that
it is possible to identify content related to diﬀerent locations using our methodology. In addition,
our classiﬁers allow us to build geographically diverse timelines with equal or better accuracy than
a non diverse baseline.

2 Related Work

There is no clear answer to the question what is Twitter? [9]. However, a wide spectrum of
research areas have seen it from diﬀerent perspectives. One of them is the geographical span of
networks: previous work has found that, the stronger the network (deﬁned in terms of reciprocity
in connections, 1-way and 2-way interactions by mentioning others), the lower is its geographical
span [14]. In terms of discussion, local events have more dense networks of discussion than global
events, and central individuals in the network are also located centrally in the physical world [18].
A demographic study of user accounts from the the U.S.A. concluded that populated cities are
over-represented, while less populated cities are under-represented in Twitter [11].

To understand population in Twitter is necessary to determine the location of a person, a
meta-attribute not directly available from user proﬁles. Diﬀerent methods have been proposed
to geolocate users. From simple detection based on the free-text self-reported location [11] to
probabilistic language models to ﬁnd out if the language used by a person denotes its location
[6, 7, 12]. Although complex models achieve higher accuracy than simpler models, they also require
a representative and often massive corpus of users and locations. Our population characterization
is based on the self-reported location, which contains geographical information in 66% of the cases
[6].

Interactions at the global level, in the sense of interplay between countries, is also an area
related to our work. Countries tend to communicate and form clusters based on language, and
geography plays a big role in interacting with others at the country level [8]. It is possible to study
how diﬀerent countries, which have diﬀerent cultures, have diﬀerent behaviors in terms of tweeting
frequencies, interactions and network structure [13]. In addition, tweeting behavior correlates to
actual culture metrics: pace of life, power distance and individualism [5]. In our work, we assume
that local diﬀerences exist, and we take this into account to deﬁne our methodology and perform
our analysis.

3 Methodology

Twitter is a social network where users post status updates with a maximum length of 140 characters,
called tweets. Connections between users are directed, and when user A follows user B, tweets
and re-tweets made by B will show-up in A’s timeline. The timeline is a list of tweets in reverse
chronological order, as it is expected that a twitter user is interested in what is happening at the
present time. To ﬁnd previously posted content, users can search or go back in the timeline, but in
both cases there are time and content limits on what can be found. Users can annotate tweets using
hashtags, keywords that start with the hash character #. Twitter supports its usage by auto-linking
a hashtag to its correspondent search results.

User Locations: To geolocate users, we relied on the self-reported location in users’ proﬁles.
Instead of querying external services for geolocation using proﬁle locations as input, as in [11], we
chose to build a list of common location names. In [6] location names extracted from Wikipedia
are used. Our approach is similar, but instead of relying on the list provided by Wikipedia, we use
templates to generate a list of valid location names.

Vector Space Model: We represent groups of tweets as documents in the vector space model
[15, 2], where the position i in the document vector represents the weight of the word i from the
vocabulary according to its frequency in the document (TF, term frequency), normalized by its
inverse document frequency (IDF ), the number of documents in which the word appears. This

3

schema, known as TF-IDF, allows to discard corpus speciﬁc stopwords by assigning lower weights
to words that appear in many documents, and allows to discover discriminating words that appear
in fewer documents.

3.1 Geolocating Tweets

It is possible that users from diﬀerent locations are aware of how timelines are biased towards
more populated locations, and thus use local hashtags that can help them and other interested
persons to ﬁnd local content. We assume the presence of uniquely local hashtags that indicate the
location a tweet is reﬀering to. Therefore, there should be a way to predict if a tweet talks about a
location, even on the absence of local relevant hashtags obtained with TF-IDF: words that co-occur
with locally relevant hashtags may also be of local usage. Its association with the identiﬁed local
hashtags and keywords can be used to geolocate users using a classiﬁer built on language models.
In previous work, this approach has yielded good results when the input dataset is: 1) big enough
to faithfully represent the diﬀerent locations to predict, and 2) diverse, covering diﬀerent topics
and events. Our approach aims at a diﬀerent scenario, where the dataset is small to medium sized.
Moreover, our focus is on singular events, and thus complex approaches might not have enough
data to build representative language models. This has motivated us to use a simpler approach:
our tweet classiﬁers use TF-IDF weighting for documents (groups of tweets). The grouping criteria
depends on the approach (see Section 4.3).

Our classiﬁers work by projecting documents into the vector space deﬁned. To project a
document into a TF-IDF space, the bag of words vector of a document is weighted according to
term frequencies and inverse document frequencies of its words in relation to the documents used
to build the model.
Additionally, to test more complex approaches in our scenario, we use Latent Semantic Indexing
[4]. Again, we use groups of tweets as documents. We build a term-document t × d matrix M ,
where Mi,j denotes the TF-IDF weight of term i in document j. Then, we do a singular value
decomposition (SVD) to decompose the matrix into:

M = T × S × DT

where T is a matrix of t × r with orthogonal columns, S is a r × r diagonal matrix of decreasing
singular values, and D is a d × r matrix of document vectors. Then, the S matrix is truncated to
k < r, where k is the number of latent dimensions or latent topics. Optimal values of k are usually
between the range 200–2000. The projection of a vector v is deﬁned as v × T × S−1.

After building the TF-IDF and LSI language models, we project documents for each location
with all their corresponding tweets into each model, and then save the projected documents for
later comparison with a query. Given a query, we also project its text into the model space, and
then we compute the cosine similarity between the projected query q and each projected location
document, L:

cosine similarity(q, L) =

q · L

(cid:107) q (cid:107)(cid:107) L (cid:107)

The location with the highest similarity to the query will be predicted as the location of the tweet
content.

4 Case Study

Our dataset is composed by tweets crawled on October 28th, 2012, related to the municipal elections
performed in Chile. The event had a distinctive hashtag, #municipales2012, which among with
other related hashtags, keywords, location and candidate names, were used as queries for the Twitter
Streaming API 4. We started to crawl tweets at 10:00 AM and stopped at midnight. Table 1 shows
the overview of the dataset after removing unrelated tweets by manual inspection of non-related
keywords and hashtags.

4.1 Virtual Population

The administrative locations of Chile are deﬁned according to the following hierarchy:
municipality → province → region → country. After looking some common location names
in the dataset, we deﬁned a list of templates to generate location names: 1) municipality, 2)
province, 3) municipality, province, 4) province, region, 5) region, 6) municipality, country, 7)
province, country, 8) region, country, 9) municipality de5 country, 10) province de country, 11)
region de country, 12) country.

We generated location names from these templates based on the oﬃcial location names from
Chile [10]6. After detecting user-reported locations compliant to our templates, we inspected the
database to search for additional location names that could be assigned to a country, province
or region of Chile, or even to Chile itself, and that were not template compliant. At the end of
this process we had 1978 valid location names. Since we covered all locations with more than one
account, we believe the usage of external services for geolocation was not needed.

Figure 1: Boxplot of population of each region in Chile with number of tweets per geolocated
account. Cropped at 30 tweets per user to showcase the diﬀerences and similarities between regions.

Table 2 contains the number of users and their published tweets per location level. We observe
that only a 42.2% of the participating accounts in the event can be localized in Chile. The remaining
accounts have empty locations, more than one location, foreign locations or long-tail valid locations
not found using our approach. However, the geolocated accounts produce 57.1% of the event
content, and as such we consider it a good sample. The logarithms of population and twitter
accounts have a pearson correlation of 0.94 for provinces (p < 0.01) and 0.95 for regions (p < 0.01).
Figure 2 shows the population and number of accounts per province (Figure 2b) and region (Figure
2a). Even though the location populations diﬀer on orders of magnitude (the ﬁgures are in log-log
scale), the rate of regional twitter accounts per 1000 inhabitants is 2.61 ± 0.97, indicating that in
relative terms, the proportion of twitter accounts in each region is similar. The average number of
tweets per account is 6.17 ± 11.53. The high standard deviation indicates that there are too many
accounts with: 1) only one tweet (the median is 2), 2) a high number of tweets. To explore this, in
Figure 1 we show the distributions of tweets per account in regions in a boxplot, showcasing that
in general the accounts have a similar behavior at each region. Still, there are many outliers that
deviate from the upper quartile of tweets per account. For instance, the most active account is a
news outlet (@cooperativa) with 479 tweets.

varies greatly between regions, the time-series are fairly similar, showcasing that the event had a
common structure at national level.

Table 3 shows the top 10 hashtags at national level (of a total of 20509 hashtags found on the
dataset). We observe that half of the top 10 is related to locations, indicating that location names
might be used as cues to indicate to what location a tweet is referring to.

Table 4 shows the 3 most discriminative hashtags per region obtained with TF-IDF, after
discarding hashtags that appear in less than 5 diﬀerent tweets. We observe that most of
these hashtags are location names inside that region (like #laserena), names of candidates
from the corresponding region (like #karenrojo), and local adaptations of general hashtags (like
#municipalesmag).

4.3 Classiﬁers

Only a 31.57% of tweets in our dataset have hashtags. Thus, searching for local hashtags would
allow users to ﬁnd less than one third of the tweets related to the event. We built our classiﬁers by
creating documents in the vector space model, using TF-IDF weighting. The deﬁnition of document
depends on the approach used. Currently we deﬁne four approaches:

• TF-IDF U: gather all tweets by geolocated users, and create one document per user with

their corresponding tweets.

• TF-IDF L: gather all tweets posted from locations, and create one document per location

with their corresponding tweets.

• TF-IDF H: pick the top 1% used hashtags (discarding the top one because it is too general),

and for each hashtag create a document with all tweets containing it.

• LSI U: as in TF-IDF U, we use user-documents to build the term-document matrix. Since

we have few documents, we use k = 200 as the number of latent dimensions.

4.4 Evaluation

To evaluate the classiﬁers we use a 10-fold stratiﬁed cross-validation. We divided the set of tweets
from geolocated users in 10 groups, maintaining the proportions of location tweets in each group,
and then run 10 iterations to evaluate the classiﬁers. In each iteration we built the models using 9
groups and test the predictions with the remaining group. In this way, each document is used 9
times for training and one time for evaluation. We do not consider retweets and replies to avoid
duplicate tweets in training and evaluation sets.

Since we consider only geolocated users, we assume that most tweets from an account are about
its location. We deﬁne that a prediction of tweet location is correct if the location predicted for the
tweet content (without considering tweet or author meta-data) matches the author location. This
approach may give false positives (i.e., when a user tweets about other locations) or false negatives

(i.e., when a user tweets about the event from a generic point of view), but in both cases it is the
best approximation we know of. This assumption is also made in previous work.

We test our classiﬁers at two levels: provinces and regions. We consider all 15 regions, but only
27 (of 54) provinces – those with equal or more tweets than the median of tweets per province
(936), as some provinces do not have enough tweets to perform the 10-fold separation or to build a
reliable model. Table 5 shows the average accuracy of our classiﬁers, deﬁned as nc/N , where nc is
the number of correct predictions and N is the total number of tweets. The baseline is a trivial
classiﬁer that assigns the most common location in terms of tweets to all predictions: Santiago
at province level, and Regi´on Metropolitana at regional level. At provincial level, TF-IDF L has
the same performance as the baseline. At regional level, TF-IDF L and TF-IDF H outperform the
baseline. It is expected that a wider geographical span has better results as each location document
is more diverse and complete. The TF-IDF L approaches have the best accuracy of our classiﬁers:
an average of 0.5718 ± 0.0057 for provinces and an average 0.6224 ± 0.0054 for regions. Although
the diﬀerence with the baseline is not signiﬁcant for provinces, in both cases we have geographical
diversity: the average location accuracy is 0.3896 ± 0.2268 for provinces and 0.4765 ± 0.1794 for
regions. The TF-IDF U approach under-performs in comparison to the other TF-IDF approaches.
This may be explained due to the bias introduced by the high number of user accounts from the
most populated places. The LSI U approach delivers a very low performance, possibly explained
by the fact that LSI works best with representative documents and big corpuses.

5 Discussion

In this section we discuss the results in the context of the research questions presented in Section 1.
Does the participating virtual population (in an event in Twitter) represent the physical population,
and to what degree? Our sample holds similar relative sizes of twitter accounts per 1000 inhabitants
for all regions (2.61 ± 0.97), and the logarithms of populations are highly correlated. Given the
diﬀerences in population seen in Figure 2, and the relative rate of accounts per location, we can say
that our sample is spatially representative and that it reﬂects the centralism from the physical
population without assuming demographic representativeness. In addition, since there are users
who were not geolocated (because of invalid, empty or long-tail locations), and because there are
people who did not participate in the event, but who are active in Twitter, we consider our sample
a lower bound of the entire Chilean population in Twitter.

Given the content generated by the virtual population, is it possible to identify local content
using a lexical approach? According to our results, it is possible to identify local content in spite
of the bias towards populated locations using solely content generated by users. This means that
vocabulary is highly related to geography. Perhaps it is possible to have better classiﬁcation

9

results if we incorporate more signals already available into the classiﬁers, such as user meta-data
and available tweet geolocation.

Our results are limited by the following factors:
Users do not tweet only about their locations, sometimes not about a location at
all. To evaluate the accuracy of our classiﬁers, we assumed that all tweets by an account are
related to its location. This is not accurate. A possible solution is to perform manual labeling and
evaluation, but this would be hard, as it requires expertise to be able to identify local content.

Dataset is mostly mono-thematic. There are events that generate national-level discussion
but are not inherently local, for example, a soccer match of the national team. It is not clear if
our approach can be applied successfully in these scenarios. In addition to this, the performance
of the LSI classiﬁer draws our attention, in the sense that theoretically LSI is better than plain
TF-IDF for language modeling. This result could be an additional signal of the biases present in
the dataset.

6 Conclusions

In this paper we presented a methodology to normalize social media impact according to geography,
i.e., to be able to ﬁnd and measure geographically diverse content. Our methodology is based on the
premise that, in addition to a common vocabulary, each location in a country has its own vocabulary
subset, comprised of unique hashtags, keywords and names. To test our methodology, we performed
a case study in which we analyzed the virtual population of Chile in Twitter that participated
in an event of national importance. We found that the virtual population is highly correlated to
the physical population and that they share the same spatial distribution. We were able to ﬁnd
the vocabulary that characterized locations, and based on that ﬁnding, we built classiﬁers that
predict the location a tweet is referring to with similar performance than a non-geographically
diverse baseline at provincial level, and better performance at the regional level. In both cases, our
approach has the potential to help to build a geographically diverse timeline and provide diverse
recommendations from a geographical perspective. Future work should study ways to understand
the degree of representation of the virtual population, and generalize the approach to work with
multi-thematic streams and other countries.
