Abstract

Even democracies endowed with the most active free press struggle to maintain
diversity of news coverage. Consolidation and market forces may cause only a
few dominant players to control the news cycle. Editorial policies may be biased
by corporate ownership relations, narrowing news coverage and focus. To an
increasing degree this problem also applies to social media news distribution,
since it is subject to the same socio-economic drivers. To study the eﬀects
of consolidation and ownership on news diversity, we model the diversity of
Chilean coverage on the basis of ownership records and social media data. We
create similarity networks of news outlets on the basis of their ownership and
the topics they cover. We then examine the relationships between the topology
of ownership networks and content similarity to characterize how ownership
aﬀects news coverage. A network analysis reveals that Chilean media is highly
concentrated both in terms of ownership as well as in terms of topics covered.
Our method can be used to determine which groups of outlets and ownership
exert the greatest inﬂuence on news coverage.

Introduction

Chomsky once commented on the role of a free and diverse press: “The smart
way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of
acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum.” [35]
This is in fact the position that many advanced democracies ﬁnd themselves in
as the diversity of news coverage seems to shrink, whereas news coverage itself
seems to continuously expand in a non-stop news cycle. For example, the US
has gone from 50 companies in 1983 to only 6 companies that control 90% of
media outlets in 2000, with further consolidation possible in the future [3]. Lack
of diversity of viewpoints, topics, and representation of communities has been
attributed to this relentless process of consolidation [38].

The emerging lack of diversity and coverage in news reporting is frequently
attributed to two speciﬁc factors. First, as news media outlets attempt to cater
to their audiences or community, they narrow their coverage to communityspeciﬁc 
material, and as a consequence further limit their audience awareness in
a homophilic cycle of mutual preferential attachment. This eﬀect has recently
been studies in terms of so-called online “ﬁlter bubbles” [2], in which users
can choose to subscribe to outlets and news that conﬁrm their pre-existing
preferences and view-points, not only narrowing their own media exposure, but
also encouraging outlets to increasingly specialize to smaller and more deﬁned
communities [4].

Second, the market-driven consolidation of the news media industry may lead
to concentration of ownership. According to Chomsky’s Propaganda model [36],
this concentration of ownership may have direct and indirect eﬀects on editorial
policies. For example, the editorial board of a newspaper owned by a group
that also invests in agriculture may perceive a pressure to report more favorably 
about agricultural initiatives. Unlike other factors such as the (frequently
explicitly publicized) political and historical mission of the outlet and its readership,
 ownership bias may thus exert a more insidious eﬀect on editorial policies
that is diﬃcult to operationalize and quantify. Nevertheless, it may have a signiﬁcant 
eﬀect on the degree to which news consumers perceive the world and
their ability to gather objective and eﬀective information.

With the emergence of online social media platforms, most news outlets, from
the smallest to the largest, have established an online presence that they use for
real-time distribution of news content [37]. These online environments provide
an opportunity to test hypotheses with respect to the drivers aﬀecting news
diversity, such as consolidation, coverage, ownership, and network homophily.

Twitter [39] is a prime example of a social media platform geared towards the
real-time distribution of news. Twitter enables its users to post short messages,
called ”tweets”, that can be up to a maximum of 140 characters in length.
Users can choose to subscribe to the tweets posted by other users. Once they
“follow” a given user they will receive that user’s Tweets in their own feed.
Tweets can originate from individual users, but also from news outlets and
other organizations. In fact, the large majority of news outlets post their most
recent headlines and a brief summary of their news on their Twitter accounts in

2

real-time. They are followed by large numbers of Twitter users who have made
Twitter their primary news source.

The Twitter platform is particularly interesting as foundation for the study
of news diversity and coverage since it is designed to constitute a large-scale social 
network. The ensemble of users-following-users establishes a social network
where tweets travel along the edges of the network. This renders the social media 
platform an ideal laboratory to apply the toolkit of network science to the
investigation of news diversity and coverage from a top-down (user to user to
news outlet ) as well as a bottom-up perspective (news outlets to their followers).
In our current study we research the inﬂuence that ownership relations have
on news media content and coverage by quantifying the strength of the relation
between news media ownership and news media content diversity in Twitter.
We analyze the user accounts of news media outlets to study how their content
evolves and overlaps, and whether or not these observations are linked to their
known ownership structure.

We focus on Chilean news outlets since they have established a signiﬁcant
social media presence with a high number of Chilean users per 1000 individuals 
[5]. In addition, Chilean news has a clearly deﬁned national audience which
is geographically and culturally well-demarcated, thereby providing a distinct
sample from previous media studies that were focused on English-speaking countries.
 The Chilean media landscape is furthermore well documented due to the
availability of detailed, publicly available data with respect to its ownership
structure, compiled by Poderopedia, a journalist NGO that aims to understand
power relationships between people, companies, and organizations.

We use the latter information to trace the existing ownership structure of
Chilean media outlets which we then compare to the structural properties of
their Twitter coverage and content, in particular with respect to the similarity
of the content they publish in social media. To this end, we deﬁne a series
of diﬀerent content similarity metrics and evaluate for each one its relation to
ownership.

Prior work has focused on studying story selection similarity within diﬀerent
news outlets [1]. However, we extend this research by searching for indications of
deeper interconnections in the mediasphere at the intra-country level. An et al.
[18] modeled the outline of digital media on Twitter, analyzing media similarity
based on the degree of overlap between their respective follower communities.
They reported a strong tendency for members of the communities to read news
from multiple sources, mostly on similar topics. Park et al. [21] proposed a
system to identify and track events, in order to present diﬀerent points of view
of the same aﬀair to readers to counteract opinion bias in news. Saez-Trumpe
et al. [17] deﬁne a methodology to identify “selection” or “gatekeeping”-bias
which consist of editorial decisions to publish certain stories and not others.
They study these biases with respect to the prominence of the stories and the
geographical location of the outlet. Since their work uses a data set of media
from diﬀerent countries, they ﬁnd that geography might inﬂuence the selection
of the stories.

Our work complements prior research by searching for potential causal path3


ways to explain the homophilic relations between groups of news outlets. This
might help to identify and characterize potential ﬁlter bubbles, possibly informing 
novel recommendation system aimed at increasing the diversity of news
consumption

Materials and methods

Our goal is to analyze whether ownership and content are correlated in the
domain of digital media news outlets. We approach this problem by studying
the similarity networks and clusters that emerge from the content published on
Twitter by news outlets in Chile. We contrast groups of similar news accounts
with their ownership in the real-world to see if they are related according to
diﬀerent similarity metrics.

In particular, we study the similarity between pairs of news accounts from
several perspectives: vocabulary, keyword-based topics, and minhash-based topics.
 We aim to determine if there exist consistent similarity-based communities
among news media outlets and if this same consistency arises in relation to
ownership.

In order to achieve this, we perform independent static analyses of news
media outlets for two years, 2015 and 2016. For each year, we study the communities 
of news outlets that are produced by using community detection over
similarity graphs built for each similarity metric. In addition, we identify clusters 
of similar outlets with the purpose of checking consistency of the resulting
similarity groups. Below, we detail our similarity metrics, and community and
clustering algorithms. Our data analysis started from the following:

• Chilean News Twitter (ds15): all tweets published by 84 prominent
Chilean news media outlets from October 30th, 2014 through May 20th,
2015 (including retweets). This data set contains 714, 973 tweets and was
created by Maldonado et al. [31] for their study that characterized Chilean
news events.

• Chilean News Twitter (ds16): A manually curated and exhaustive
list of news outlets in Chile for year 2016. This list derived from the
Wikipedia page listing Chilean news media [40] and the independent journalistic 
website Poderopedia

We joined both sets and kept all of those that had an active Twitter account;
then, we downloaded all of the tweets generated by those accounts from October
25, 2015 to January 25, 2016. Overall, the ds16 collection contained 365 news
accounts and 756,864 tweets (also including retweets). Both data sets include
tweet metadata, such as location and user identiﬁers.

Standard text normalization and cleaning techniques were used to convert
Tweet content in both data sets to lower case and remove stop-words, URLs,
and punctuation. In addition, news outlets that posted less than one tweet per
day on average were removed, leaving 79 news outlets for ds15 and 341 in ds16.

As for ownership information, we manually mapped Poderopedia’s inﬂuence
database [41] to our lists of news media accounts on Twitter. As for grouping
news media outlets according to their owners, we simply consider two outlets
to belong to the same group if and only if they’re owned by the same entity.
There are at least two possible issues with this. First, some news media outlets
are owned by multiple entities: in this case, we selected the major partner. On
the other hand, there also exist ownership relationships between owners. In this
case, we selected the entity that subsumes all others as the owner. As a result
we obtained the ﬁrst complete database of newspaper ownership information in
Chile (Url to be made available for the camera-ready version of this work).

Our datasets include news outlets that belong to the two biggest news media
groups in Chile: the El Mercurio group and the Copesa media conglomerate,
which form what has been called in the past a newspaper duopoly [26]. We
also have representatives of a group of digital newspapers, the Mi Voz network.
Other owners with smaller number of outlets are also included, as well as a
group of unknown-to-us ownership. We note that we are interested not only in
news outlets that share owners, but also those that behave as if they did.

Similarity metrics between news outlets

We are interested in ﬁnding how related news outlets are using their content.
In other words, we study their vocabularies and how the stories they select may
indicate a connection between their editorial policy. For topic-based similarity
metrics, we decided to use keywordand 
minhash-based similarity to validate
the consistency of the results beyond the selected methodology.

1. Vocabulary-based similarity. We model each news media outlet as a
single document composed of all of the tweets posted by its news account
during the time of our data collection. Each document is converted to its
vector-space representation using a tf-idf weighting scheme [27]. Similarity
is then computed as the cosine similarity between two vectors [32].

2. Keyword-based topic similarity. This is a more elaborate notion of
content-based similarity between news media outlets, which is based on
whether two sources eﬀectively talk about the same topics.

We identify the topics that were discussed during each day in our dataset.
Each topic is obtained by mining frequent term-sets from the tweets posted
that day and then joining these sets by word co-occurrence (within the
same day).

A daily vector representation is computed for each outlet based on the
day’s topics; daily similarities between pairs of outlets are obtained as
the cosine similarities of pairs of these vectors. Finally, the overall topic
similarity between two outlets is deﬁned as their average daily similarity.

3. Minhash-based topic similarity. This is an alternative similarity measure 
based on text, inspired by prior work for identifying similar documents.
 We represent the text of each tweet posted by a news outlet by

5

its k-shingles, using word-based shingles and k = 3 (this is based on prior
ﬁndings that indicate that k equal to 2 or 3 word shingles are appropriate
for short documents [7–9]). We set k = 3 to obtain a ﬁne grain classiﬁer
identifying speciﬁc stories, rather than broader topics for which a smaller
value of k may have been chosen.

A 4-min-wise hashing is applied to each tweet representation, this results
in compact summaries of documents that are eﬀective for identifying similarity 
[6–8]. Accordingly, we cluster tweets using their minhash similarity.
We refer to these clusters as topics, as this is a notion that has been used in
past literature to identify “stories” that relate to a common event or topic
among news outlets [1,17]. Similarity between two news outlets is then deﬁned 
by the co-occurrence of two news outlets with respect to a same topic.
In particular, the value of the similarity between outlet A and B is the
conditional probability P r(A|B) of the occurrence of A in a cluster given
that B occurs in that same cluster. This similarity measure is directional,
expressing how likely it is that a story tweeted by B is also tweeted by
A [18]. In order to deﬁne a symmetric similarity measure we further specify
the similarity between A and B as sim(A, B) = max(P r(A|B), P r(B|A)).

Similar news outlet identiﬁcation

In order to identify similar news outlets, we create diﬀerent similarity graphs
based on each of the aforementioned similarity metrics and each of the datasets.
Formally, we deﬁne a generic similarity graph G = (V, S) for the set of news
outlets V = {v1, v2, . . . , vn} and similarity measure S : (vi, vj) → IR+, as a
graph where each pair of outlets vi and vj are connected by an edge of weight
S : (vi, vj). This yields a complete, weighted, and undirected graph.

Using each similarity graph, we apply graph partitioning techniques to ﬁnd
groups of similar news outlets. For all six similarity graphs we used a hierarchical,
 agglomerative community discovery algorithm [33], and the normalized cut
technique [19]. This methodology has been proved to be successful in similar
problems [34].

Results and discussion

Figure 1 shows the communities (represented as boxes) of news outlets obtained
from Topics collected in ds15 (left column) and ds16 (right column). The curves
that connect both columns of boxes represent the number of outlets (or the
proportion of outlets) shared by the communities at the two ends of the curve.
For example, the ﬁrst community in the top left (from ds15) has 18 (3/4) outlets
in common with the ﬁrst community in the top right (from ds16) and shares only
6 (1/4) outlets with the second. Also, the last community in left is identical to
the last community in the right. Since results do not vary signiﬁcantly between
the two datasets, and to save space, we only report results for one of the datasets;
the more recent one, ds16.
In the same vein, we only report results for one

6

of the graph partitioning algorithms (community detection) since the resulting
communities in both cases are very similar. This congruence supports the notion
that the communities found are signiﬁcant, denoting a real structure in the
data (see Fig 2). In any case, the rest of the analysis can be found online at
https://github.com/eelejalde/Chilean_Media_Power_Structure.git and
in the Supporting Information section of this paper. This notwithstanding,
there were some cases for which diﬀerences were found, and we do report these,
making it clear where they come from.

Table 1 summarizes several metrics for community discovery over both data
sets. The column Outlets is the initial number of outlets in the similarity graph
(see Section Materials and methods), while Grouped is the number of outlets
that were included in one community. Column Comm. is the number of communities 
found by the algorithm, while Mod. and Cond. show, respectively, the
modularity and conductance of the sub-graphs formed by the Grouped outlets
within returned communities (see Section Materials and methods).

Figure 2: Communities vs. Clusters Topic (keyword-based) similarity
on ds16.

The ﬁrst thing to notice is that Topic similarity creates the lowest number
of communities. Also, this similarity for the Dataset ds15 includes almost all
outlets, but for ds16 it only grouped about a third of the total dataset. We
think this is because this similarity is a coarse-grained classiﬁcation that only
captures the strongest signals. If we focus on ds15, the topic similarity has the
highest modularity, which means it creates well deﬁned communities. However,
we have to take into account that this dataset only contains 84 outlets that
comprise most of the largest, most famous newspapers of the country. When
we look at the ds16 dataset we ﬁnd a more diverse set of outlets (in size and
content).
In ds16, Topic similarity shows similar performance if un-grouped
outlets are excluded. In turn, MinHash seems to be more sensitive to weaker
signals, creating a more ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation. We can see this in the high
modularity achieved with ds16 in spite of having included most outlets. On the
other hand, Vocabulary similarity has the lowest performance in both datasets,
which gives us the intuition that there are no particularly strong diﬀerences in
vocabulary between the analyzed outlets.

Vocabulary similarity

Communities obtained for the Vocabulary similarity over the ds16 dataset include 
four big communities and ten smaller ones. Most of the smaller communities 
form around geographical information, as their relevant words include city
names and places. In some cases, the outlet names also denote a geographical
region, as many regional outlets have location-related names: “El Mercurio de
Valpara´ıso”, for example, is based in the city of Valpara´ıso. Thus, for some
communities, we can infer regional-focused content by manually inspecting the
names of the outlets grouped within it. We also ﬁnd small communities pointing

8

to a particular topic, such as aquaculture, and a particular type of media, such
as radio stations. This is possibly caused by the fact that these two characteristics 
heavily inﬂuence the respective outlets’ vocabularies: aquaculture is a
very speciﬁc activity with its own terms, and radio stations tend to use a more
informal language than other media outlets (see Tables 7 in the Supporting
Information section for more detail).

There is also a pair of big communities that seems to comprise many diﬀerent
outlets: the ﬁrst has many national-scope media, while the other has many that
seem oriented toward regional locations. The characterization of ownership for
the same set of communities can be seen in Table 2. Notice that over a half
of the community with ID 4 is owned by El Mercurio. Similarly, over half of
the community with ID 6 is owned by Grupo Diarios en Red. On the other
hand, the other two big communities (IDs 2 and 7) do not have any owner that
heavily dominates the group. For the rest of the communities, even when they
are very small ones, it is diﬃcult to ﬁnd homogeneity in the ownership of the
groups. This results suggest a low inﬂuence of ownership of a news outlet over
the vocabulary they use.

Topic similarity: Keyword based

The computed community structure has a big community containing many national 
and local-scope media outlets, whose most relevant keywords are mainly
centered around political and sports ﬁgures and current issues. A small community 
is particularly oriented towards one particular region, Valpara´ıso; analogously,
 another community seems to be focused on another region, Aconcagua
Province. The remaining communities seem to lack a unifying theme, displaying
topics related to general advice, geographical entities and buzzwords that aim
to capture audience interest.

When ownership comes into play, these remaining communities acquire meaning 
(see Table 3). The communities with IDs 2, 4, 5 and 6 have each an entity
owning over 80% of them. In contrast to the results seen before for the Vocabulary 
similarity, this indicates that ownership might have an inﬂuence on topics
discussed.

Outlets owned by groups like El Mercurio or Diarios en Red have recognizable 
clusters using the agglomerative community detection algorithm. The
Copesa group (the closest competitor of El Mercurio) does not have its own,
clearly deﬁned, community. This may be due to the kind of outlets it owns (a
lot of them are magazines specialized in diﬀerent topics). This makes it harder
to identify any owner inﬂuence on their editorial strategies, which seems to be
a limitation of the current methodology.

Topic similarity: Minhash-based

Using the minhash technique over the tweets in ds16, we identiﬁed 100,774
topics that contain 438,353 tweets. In the case of ds15, we identify 83,582 topics
containing a total of 254,650 tweets. We looked for topics that had tweets from

multiple news outlets. In ds16, out of all the topics, 31,423 contained tweets
from more than one news outlet (31.2%) and in ds15 17, 211 (20.6%). Using
these topics, we used the co-occurrences for each pair of news outlets to calculate
their similarity (see Section Materials and methods). We found that all news
outlets co-occur at least once with some other news source, for both ds16 and
ds15.

Results for Minhash-based similarity have features like those seen in the
keyword-based communities. These communities are easily identiﬁable even
by visual inspection (see Fig 3). We observe two big communities with many
diﬀerent media outlets (with IDs 1 and 3), some small ones (with IDs of 4,

The community with an ID of 0 corresponds to un-grouped media outlets. Entities owning
over 10% of the outlets in a community are listed next to it.

5, 10 and 11) which, as before, under manual inspection of the outlets name
seem to have speciﬁc scopes (e.g. the Linares Province, aquaculture, the Chiloe
Province or the Maip´u commune).

Ownership features help explain the remaining communities as shown in Table 
4. Communities 2, 6, 7 and 9 have entities that own a big part of them.
The small community with an ID of 11 does not have a clear meaning or unifying 
theme. Notice that in this case the community with ID of 3 has similar
characteristics to the communities with ID 0 for the other similarity measures
(the un-grouped outlets). This community has the biggest number of outlets
and the main owner has less than 10% of them.

Even though the communities in Minhash-based similarity graph are partially 
explained by ownership, the correlation is not as strong as in the clustering 
obtained from the normalized cut algorithm. As mentioned above, this is
one case where we think the diﬀerences between the two algorithms are worth
mentioning: for this particular similarity graph the normalized cut clustering
algorithm actually improves results (see Table 5).

If we assume that the biggest cluster (with ID 0) is the one containing the
outlets that do not ﬁt in any other group (equivalent to the un-grouped outlets
in the community detection), then we get clusters that are very similar to the
communities we obtained for topic (keyword-based) similarity.

On one hand, the clusters leave out a bigger number of outlets than the community 
structure. This reduces the number of clustered outlets to an amount
similar to that found with topic (keyword-based) similarity. On the other hand,
it ﬁnds a classiﬁcation with a better owner separation. As we can see in Table
5, there are two relatively small clusters (with ID 8 and 10). Beside those two,
all other clusters are heavily, if not entirely, dominated by one owner.

Figure 3: Similarity graph, using Topic (MinHash-based) similarity on
ds16. Only representing edges with weight over (mean+2std). We
assigned diﬀerent colors to the biggest owners.

Clustering metrics

Based on these results, we hypothesize that ownership relationships are similar
to the ones based on content. Given that we have the actual owners of most
news outlets in our data sets, we used this as a ground truth to evaluate the
performance of our methodology. To this end, we computed diﬀerent clustering
metrics using ownership information as class labels.

We used the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to quantify the degree of correspondence 
between the set of communities found by our methodology and
the sets of clusters deﬁned by the actual owners of the news outlets. ARI
scores are normalized against chance, so scores close to 0.0 indicate random
label assignments, 1.0 indicates a perfect match, and negative scores indicate
a correspondence lower than what is expected for random assignments. Similarly,
 the Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) index gives a sense of how
much information we can obtain about one distribution given the other one.
AMI scores are also adjusted with respect to the expected value (subtracting
the expected value from the Mutual Information score). Again, scores close to
0.0 indicate random assignments and a 1.0 score indicates two identical assignments.
 The Normalized variation of the Mutual Information Index (NMI) also
gives a greater score as the communities are closer to a perfect recreation of

ownership classes. Moreover, NMI does not penalize if the classes are further

13

subdivided into smaller clusters. The results of the application of these indices
(given in Table 6) suggest non-random clusters. Homogeneity (Hom) is maximized 
when each cluster contains members of a single class, while completeness
(Com) measures the desirable objective of assigning all members of a class to
a single cluster.

Prior to calculations, we removed outlets without ownership information
and outlets with owners that only have a single outlet, since they do not add
any relevant information. Additionally, there are outlets that do not belong to
any of the communities we found. They could be discarded, but we might be
deleting valuable information: our algorithm indicates their content is diﬀerent
from the others’. For this reason, we preserve each of them as a community
of size 1. Though reasonable, this might distort some comparison metrics, as
the correspondence of single-outlet communities is perfect if they’re isolated in
both the content-based and the owner-based community structures. As both
the number of considered outlets and the number of communities is altered
by these decisions, we specify them in Table 6 (columns Outlets and Comm.
respectively).

Rows represent the diﬀerent metrics used to calculate the similarity graphs. Columns
represent the scores of the indices calculated using our ground-truth as reference (ARI:
Adjusted Rand Index, AMI: Adjusted Mutual Information Based, NMI: Normalized
Mutual Information Based, Hom: Homogeneity, Com: Completeness)

Table 6 shows the results of these indices over the communities obtained
from our similarity graphs. Once again, we can see that the vocabulary-based
similarity does not give a good prediction on news outlets that belong to the
same owner: Vocabulary gets the lowest score for all metrics. This poor behavior
is shown in a more graphical way in Fig 4. On the other hand, we can see that
topic similarities do show higher degrees of correspondence with owner classes,
which is consistent with previous observations. Keyword-based similarity communities 
have high homogeneity, while Minhash-based communities show very
high completeness, shown in Figs 5 and 6.

We also included in Table 6 the results for indices over the normalized cut
clustering obtained for the topic (MinHash-based) similarity. We follow the same
procedure for clusters, i.e., we removed outlets without ownership information
and outlets with owners that only have a single outlet. Also, we moved each
remaining outlet in cluster ID 0 to its own individual cluster. The completeness
(Com) is altered by the bigger number of clusters of size one created from outlets
in the cluster with ID 0. The results for this variation (clusters over minhashbased 
similarity) are the highest for most indices, presenting this technique as

Conclusions

We introduced an analysis of Chilean news media outlets based on the information 
that each news source chooses to post in Twitter and the similarity clusters
of news outlets that arise from this content. The study whether ownership inﬂuences 
the content produced by diﬀerent news sources is an important area of
research to make possible biases explicit.

In general, our results indicate that ownership does play an important role
in news content similarity. Big, national-scope media with big audiences tend to
group together in their own community; other outlets, generally with a more local 
scope, group according to a mix of ownership and some geographical features
that we inferred (such as Mercurio de Valpara´ıso).

We studied several similarity metrics as well as diﬀerent ways in which to
identify clusters (or communities) in our data. The indices that we calculated
(e.g., ARI and AMI) suggest non-random clusters.

These results seem in agreement with our hypothesis, since similarity based
on vocabulary may be attributed to other factors (e.g. geographic zones); on
the other hand, our other analyses indicate a correlation between owners and
their selection of topics (which can be interpreted as a common editorial policy).
We show that our results are consistent over time. We study two nonoverlapping 
in time datasets, ds15 and ds16, and show that they both present
consistent properties.

A limitation of our methodology is that when outlets are too specialized (e.g.
magazines on automobiles, fashion, etc.), even if they belong to the same owner,
they do not cluster together. This is due to the nature of the stories that they
publish, since by design they do not share any signiﬁcant part of their content.
It is therefore diﬃcult to conclude that there is any inﬂuence by owners in the
content generation of these speciﬁc type of outlets.

Some owners only have one news outlet. As we saw in the Results and
discussion section, our similarity measures based on topics do a good job in
pulling apart these special cases from the biggest groups of owners by clustering
them together in a diﬀerent community (our cluster with id 0 above). What
we are after, however, is the identiﬁcation of more than one outlet with a single
owner such that content in those diﬀerent media may be aﬀected by a single
editorial line.

We have shown that using a language-independent and fast approach we are
able to easily discover “editorial homophily”. This can have several applications,
 such as help mitigate the “ﬁlter bubble eﬀect” in people’s news media
consumption by recommending more diverse news sources.
It can also help
identify “hidden owners”, in the sense that we can identify news sources that
behave as if they had a same owner, despite not declaring so publicly. Overall,
our ﬁndings could help towards promoting a media structure that is less biased
towards very few groups.
