•  Summary 
•  The research being reported should have been conducted in an ethical 

and responsible manner and should comply with all relevant legislation. 

•  Researchers should present their results clearly, honestly, and without 

fabrication, falsification or inappropriate data manipulation.  

•  Researchers should strive to describe their methods clearly and 

unambiguously so that their findings can be confirmed by others. 

•  Researchers should adhere to publication requirements that submitted work 

is original, is not plagiarised, and has not been published elsewhere.  

•  Authors should take collective responsibility for submitted and published 

work. 

•  The authorship of research publications should accurately reflect individuals’ 

contributions to the work and its reporting.  

•  Funding sources and relevant conflicts of interest should be disclosed.

Introduction 
Publication is the final stage of research and therefore a responsibility for all 
researchers. Scholarly publications are expected to provide a detailed and permanent 
record of research. Because publications form the basis for both new research and the 
application of findings, they can affect not only the research community but also, 
indirectly, society at large. Researchers therefore have a responsibility to ensure that 
their publications are honest, clear, accurate, complete and balanced, and should avoid 
misleading, selective or ambiguous reporting. Journal editors also have 
responsibilities for ensuring the integrity of the research literature and these are set 
out in companion guidelines. 
 
This document aims to establish international standards for authors of scholarly 
research publications and to describe responsible research reporting practice. We hope 
these standards will be endorsed by research institutions, funders, and professional 
societies; promoted by editors and publishers; and will aid in research integrity 
training.

The research literature serves as a record not only of what has been discovered

and permission requirements. If in doubt, authors should seek permission from the

relationships that might be considered likely to affect the interpretation of their 
findings or which editors, reviewers or readers might reasonably wish to know. This 
includes any relationship to the journal, for example if editors publish their own 
research in their own journal. In addition, authors should follow journal and 
institutional requirements for disclosing competing interests.

but also of who made the discovery. The authorship of research publications should 
therefore accurately reflect individuals’ contributions to the work and its reporting.  
 
In cases where major contributors are listed as authors while those who made 
6.2 
less substantial, or purely technical, contributions to the research or to the publication 
are listed in an acknowledgement section, the criteria for authorship and 
acknowledgement should be agreed at the start of the project. Ideally, authorship 
criteria within a particular field should be agreed, published and consistently applied 
by research institutions, professional and academic societies, and funders. While 
journal editors should publish and promote accepted authorship criteria appropriate to 
their field, they cannot be expected to adjudicate in authorship disputes. 
Responsibility for the correct attribution of authorship lies with authors themselves 
working under the guidance of their institution. Research institutions should promote 
and uphold fair and accepted standards of authorship and acknowledgement. When 
required, institutions should adjudicate in authorship disputes and should ensure that 
due process is followed. 
 
6.3 
criteria (i.e. made a substantial contribution to the work) are rewarded with authorship 
and that deserving authors are not omitted. Institutions and journal editors should 
encourage practices that prevent guest, gift, and ghost authorship.

Accountability and responsibility 
All authors should have read and be familiar with the reported work and 

6.4 
accepted versions of the publication. Any change to the author list should be approved 
by all authors including any who have been removed from the list. The corresponding 
author should act as a point of contact between the editor and the other authors and 
should keep co-authors informed and involve them in major decisions about the 
publication (e.g. responding to reviewers’ comments).

should ensure that publications follow the principles set out in these guidelines. In 
most cases, authors will be expected to take joint responsibility for the integrity of the 
research and its reporting. However, if authors take responsibility only for certain 
aspects of the research and its reporting, this should be specified in the publication.  
 
7.2 
promptly if errors or omissions are discovered after publication. 
 
7.3 
Authors should abide by relevant conventions, requirements, and regulations 
to make materials, reagents, software or datasets available to other researchers who 
request them. Researchers, institutions, and funders should have clear policies for 
handling such requests. Authors must also follow relevant journal standards. While 
proper acknowledgement is expected, researchers should not demand authorship as a 
condition for sharing materials.

manner. 
 
8.4 
generally allow their findings to be reported in the press if they have been accepted 
for publication (but not yet published) in a scholarly publication. Authors and their 
institutions should liaise and cooperate with publishers to coordinate media activity 
(e.g. press releases and press conferences) around publication. Press releases should 
accurately reflect the work and should not include statements that go further than the 
research findings.

Appropriate approval, licensing or registration should be obtained before the 
research begins and details should be provided in the report (e.g. Institutional Review 
Board, Research Ethics Committee approval, national licensing authorities for the use 
of animals).  
 
9.2 
received the appropriate approval and was carried out ethically (e.g. copies of 
approvals, licences, participant consent forms). 
 
9.3   Researchers should not generally publish or share identifiable individual data 
collected in the course of research without specific consent from the individual (or 
their representative). Researchers should remember that many scholarly journals are 
now freely available on the internet, and should therefore be mindful of the risk of 
causing danger or upset to unintended readers (e.g. research participants or their 
families who recognise themselves from case studies, descriptions, images or 
pedigrees).  
 
9.4 
study and a data analysis plan for the prespecified outcomes should be prepared and 
followed. Secondary or post hoc analyses should be distinguished from primary 
analyses and those set out in the data analysis plan. 
 
9.5 
contribute to understanding. In particular, there is an ethical responsibility to publish 
the findings of all clinical trials. The publication of unsuccessful studies or 
experiments that reject a hypothesis may help prevent others from wasting time and 
resources on similar projects. If findings from small studies and those that fail to 
reach statistically significant results can be combined to produce more useful 
information (e.g. by meta-analysis) then such findings should be published. 
 
9.6 
Authors should supply research protocols to journal editors if requested (e.g. 
for clinical trials) so that reviewers and editors can compare the research report to the 
protocol to check that it was carried out as planned and that no relevant details have 
been omitted. Researchers should follow relevant requirements for clinical trial 
registration and should include the trial registration number in all publications arising 
from the trial. 
 

The appropriate statistical analyses should be determined at the start of the
