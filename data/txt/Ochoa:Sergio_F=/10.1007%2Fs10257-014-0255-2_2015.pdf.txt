Abstract
e-Business organizations must frequently face changes in their systems
to stay competitive. However,
is not guaranteed the new systems will be
acceptable for the workers. The e-Business Technology Acceptance Model (EB-
TAM) model is proposed in this paper as a way to study acceptance before actual
deployment of a new system. This model takes into account other models reported
in the literature, but it is essentially oriented towards small and medium-sized
organizations, which usually have limited human and economic resources. The
model was used in three companies, and the evaluation instrument was applied at
three stages of a system replacement process: (1) before the new system was
deployed, in order to capture the independent variables, (2) after 1.5 months of use,
and (3) after 9 months of use. Unlike most models reported in the literature, EBTAM 
shows reasonable predictions about technology acceptance without requiring
expert evaluators or many users experienced using the system under evaluation.
This fact makes EBTAM easier to implement and use than others evaluation
methods, which is particularly important in small organizations given their relatively 
scarce resources and expertise for this type of evaluations.

1 Introduction

D. Leyton et al.

Many companies routinely change their way of doing business, and others just begin
to do it. All of them have competitiveness as a driving force. At the end of the day,
just ﬂexible organizations offering high quality products or services at reasonable
prices are able to survive in the global market economy.

The deployment of new information technology (IT) systems for e-Business to
improve competitiveness represents an opportunity, but also a challenge for these
organizations (Grandon and Pearson 2004a, b). Many things may go wrong,
including usability problems, difﬁculties to work collaboratively with other users,
and reluctance of the workers to use the system because they think it is inferior to
the current system or because they have to learn a new tool. Projects trying to
deploy new IT solutions may generate important ﬁnancial losses and delays for
enterprises. Therefore, it is often convenient to predict technology acceptance
before investing on it. This is particularly relevant for small and medium-size
organizations (SMO), because they typically have few human and economic
resources to address this problem. Although people promoting the adoption of these
IT solutions in SMO know the technology, most of them do not know how to
forecast the results of such an adoption process for a certain organization. Therefore,
the method that helps these people to do this prediction should be simple,
inexpensive and easy to apply. Usability restrictions on these methods jeopardize
their suitability to be used in SMO. Moreover, a failure in a technology adoption
project can be critical for some small organizations, since these companies probably
do not have a second chance to ﬁx a previous error. Therefore not making mistakes
may be much more critical in small organizations than in large ones.

to predict

A very well-known model

technology usage is the Technology
Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis 1989; Davis et al. 1989). TAM is based on the
users’ perceptions regarding the system usability and usefulness. Many models
inspired by TAM have been designed (Chang et al. 2010), for instance TAM2
(Venkatesh and Davis 2000) and TAM3 (Venkatesh and Bala 2008). The Uniﬁed
Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) (Venkatesh et al. 2003) is
another one, being very effective in predicting the acceptance of IT solutions.

Some e-Business solutions require collaboration among users, so they have to
interact and work with each other in order to achieve their goals (Chong et al. 2009).
Some models have been developed in the context of collaborative technologies, like
the Technology Transition Model (TTM) (Briggs et al. 1998) or the Adoption of
Collaboration Technologies (Brown et al. 2010).

All these predictive models use questionnaires to measure their independent
variables, and users’ experience using the new system is a requirement to answer
each item. This could be a problem since users may not have that experience; thus a
period using the system could be required before applying the model. This could be
expensive in terms of time and money, particularly for small business organizations,
which usually have few resources. This fact may have a negative impact because
many current e-Business organizations are medium-sized or small.

Trying to help address this challenge, this paper proposes a new model, named
e-Business Technology Acceptance Model (EBTAM), which was particularly

123

Technology acceptance in e-Business environments

213

designed to predict the user acceptance of the IT solutions in SMO. This model is
based on TAM, but it does not require users’ experience with the system to be
acquired or developed. Variables from TAM2, TAM3 and UTAUT were studied
and some of them were included as well in the proposed model. EBTAM is also
suitable to evaluate the adoption of collaboration technologies, since it considers
many characteristics of
these system types. Typically, e-Business involves
collaborative processes where (direct or indirect) interaction among participants
must be supported. These people work in teams to reach the team goals, although
they can play different roles. If the work scenario adheres to these features, then the
EBTAM model could be used to diagnose the technology adoption for that work
domain.

Next section reviews the related work. Section 3 presents the EBTAM model and
its main components. Section 4 evaluates the proposal through three case studies in
Chilean small and medium organizations. Section 5 presents the conclusions and
future work.

2 Related work

Some of the most relevant TAMs reported in the literature are reviewed and brieﬂy
described in the next subsections. These models are suitable to evaluate adoption of
IT systems in general, not speciﬁcally for e-Business.

2.1 Technology Acceptance Model

TAM (Davis 1989; Davis et al. 1989) was created to explain the use of IT in various
environments, modeling how users accept and use technology tools. TAM is based
on the theory of reasoned action (TRA) (Ajzen and Fishbein 1980), whose goal is to
predict people’s behavior based on their attitudes and intentions. It is done by
analyzing the relationships among convictions, attitude, intention and behavior. The
variables predicted by TAM are the following: perceived usefulness (PU), perceived
ease-of-use (PEOU), attitude towards behavior (A), and behavioral intention (BI).
The PU is the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system
would enhance his/her job performance. The PEOU indicates the degree to which a
person believes that using a particular system would be free of effort. The attitude
towards behavior shows an individual’s positive or negative feelings (evaluative
affect) about performing the target behavior. The BI represents the degree to which
a person has formulated conscious plans to perform or not perform some speciﬁed
future behavior. Of these variables, PEOU and PU are two key ones for the TAM
model. PEOU is related to system usability, while PU is related to the utility of the
system, and how it will increase the user performance during the activity to be
supported.

There are other variables, also known as external variables, affecting the system
usage, e.g. system design, user attributes, task characteristics, and organizational
structure (Fishbein and Ajzen 1975). In fact, Bailey and Pearson (1983) identiﬁed
39 factors affecting information system satisfaction. TAM states that external

123

Fig. 1 Structure of TAM

variables affect PEOU. PU is determined by external variables and PEOU. A is
affected by PU and PEOU. System use is determined by BI, which is affected by
A and PU. Figure 1 summarizes the relationships among the variables measured by
TAM.

There have been some preliminary proposals that have tried to move the research
on IT adoption from the current TAM-centric place to a new scenario with more
diverse approaches. Examples of these approaches are presented by Benbasat and
Barki (2007), and Bagozzi (2007). Unfortunately, these new perspectives have not
prospered at this moment.

2.2 TAM2

TAM2 (Venkatesh and Davis 2000) is a TAM extension, and it considers PU and BI
based on social inﬂuences and cognitive processes. TAM2 adds the following
variables as part of its prediction model: subjective norm, voluntariness, image,
experience, job relevance, output quality and result demonstrability. The ﬁrst
variable represents the perceived social pressure, i.e. an individual’s perception of
whether people important to the individual think the behavior should be performed.
The voluntariness indicates the extent to which potential adopters perceive the
adoption of the IT solution is non-mandatory. The image determines the degree to
which use of an innovation is perceived to enhance one’s status in one’s social
system. The experience indicates the user capability to use the target system. The
job relevance represents the individual’s perception on the degree to which the
target system is relevant to his/her job. The output quality establishes the degree to
which an individual believes that the system supports his/her tasks well. The result
demonstrability shows the tangibility of the results when using the new system.

2.3 TAM3

TAM3 (Venkatesh and Bala 2008) is a TAM2 extension. It keeps the variables
affecting PU and it proposes that PEOU be determined by the computer anxiety,

123

Technology acceptance in e-Business environments

215

Fig. 2 Structure of TAM3

playfulness and self-efﬁcacy, and also by the perceived enjoyment, objective
usability and perception of external control (Fig. 2). The computer anxiety indicates
the degree of an individual’s apprehension, or even fear, when she/he is faced with
the possibility of using IT-based solutions. The computer playfulness represents the
degree of cognitive spontaneity in computer interactions. The computer self-efﬁcacy
shows the degree to which an individual believes that he/she has the ability to
perform speciﬁc tasks using an IT-based solution. The perceived enjoyment
indicates the extent to which the activity of using a speciﬁc system is perceived to
be enjoyable in its own right, aside from any performance consequences resulting
from system use. The objective usability makes a comparison of systems based on
the actual level of effort (rather than perceptions) required to complete speciﬁc
tasks. The perception of external control represents the degree to which an
individual believes that organizational and technical resources exist to support the
use of the system.

2.4 UTAUT

Venkatesh et al. (2003) proposed UTAUT, a framework to integrate the most
important TAMs. This framework uses four key variables: performance expectancy,
effort expectancy, social inﬂuence and facilitating conditions. The effort expectancy
represents the degree of usability of the system. The facilitating conditions indicate
the degree to which an individual believes that an organizational and technical

123

216

D. Leyton et al.

Fig. 3 Structure of the UTAUT model

infrastructure exists to support use of the system. The performance expectancy
shows the degree to which an individual believes that using the system will help
him/her to attain gains in job performance. The social inﬂuence indicates the degree
to which an individual perceives how important is that others believe he or she
should use the new system. These factors affect BI and Use directly;
this
relationship is moderated by gender, age, experience and voluntariness. Figure 3
shows the structure of the UTAUT framework and the relationships among its
components.

2.5 Technology Transition Model (TTM)

Briggs et al. (1998) proposed TTM as an extension of TAM to predict the transition
of group support systems and collaboration technologies. Transition is the period of
time which starts when some person in an organization expresses interest in using a
new technology and which ends when a community of users has become selfsustaining.
 TTM proposes that BI is determined by four factors (Fig. 4): perceived
magnitude of net value (M), perceived frequency of net value (F), perceived net
value of transition (T), and certainty (C).

The perceived magnitude of net value is a subjective appreciation of the utility
that users can obtain using the system. The perceived frequency of net value
indicates how frequently users can obtain the net value from the system. The
perceived net value of transition represents the value derived from the transition
activity itself, apart from the value the new system will deliver. The certainty is the
subjective probability the obtained net value will be that expected by users.
According to TTM, the use of the system is given by Eq. (1)

2.6 Acceptance model of collaborative technologies

Vaidya and Seetharaman (2008) proposed a TAM extension in the context of
collaborative technologies. This model contains four external variables which
directly affect the use of collaborative technologies (Fig. 5): information intensity of
task, collaborative orientation, technology drive and performance pressures. The
information intensity of task refers to the level of information processing required to
perform the task. It has three dimensions: complexity, uncertainty and ambiguity of
the performed task. When groups engage in information intensive tasks, it is
imperative they look for tools and technologies that enable them to perform such
tasks, thus resulting in the use of IT, especially collaborative technology.

Considering a task group within an organizational environment, the tendency of
the group to be collaborative in their approach to task execution will have an impact
on their extent of use of collaborative technology to execute the group task. Such a
tendency is known as collaborative orientation. A group’s orientation towards IT
depicts the general tendency of the group (technology drive) to apply and use IT for
various organizational activities. However, a group which performs a task which is
signiﬁcant in the organization scheme of tasks is likely to experience greater

pressures to perform and hence to use IT support for task execution (performance
pressures).

2.7 Integration of TAM with collaboration technologies

Legris et al. (2003) criticized the TAM model for not including organizational and
social factors. In a more inclusive model, Brown et al. (2010) extended TAM with
collaboration technology aspects to predict the use of this kind of technologies. Four
technology characteristics,
new variables are added in this model
individual and group characteristics, and task characteristics. The ﬁrst variable
represents the characteristics that are used and experienced by the users.
Collaboration technologies are social
technologies that provide a variety of
capabilities that can be used in various ways by different groups and individuals.
The individual and group characteristics are potentially important to the successful
use of collaboration technology because different individuals and groups have
different needs. Finally, the characteristics of a task have long been recognized as
an important factor affecting users’ performance and satisfaction.

(Fig. 6):

3 The EBTAM model

In the EBTAM deﬁnition, TAM was used as the basis, and some variables from
TAM2, TAM3 and UTAUT were also added. Like these last three models, the
inﬂuence of PEOU and PU over BI is proposed, avoiding the use of A (attitude
towards behavior). Also, it is important to avoid considering USE as a measure of
success when that use is an obligation. In those cases, BI will determine the
acceptance level. In the next section, PU and PEOU of TAM will be analyzed in
detail and adapted to be included in the EBTAM model.

3.1 Estimated utility

With the requirement of avoiding the user’s previous experience using the system,
perceived utility is a difﬁcult factor to pre-calculate, since most future users have
never used the system. Therefore, they do not have the experience to perceive
whether the system will have some usefulness for them. A better option to address
this point is to modify this factor and calculate it using estimations from experts.
However, having those experts is also a demanding requirement, if the main goal is
to simplify the application to obtain a low cost evaluation process. Thus, an
alternative option seems to be using a few people within the same company, who
know the services provided by the system, to estimate the usefulness of the IT
solution. These people, named evaluators, work in a way similar to Wideband
Delphi process for estimating software processes (Potter and Sakry 2002); i.e. they
have to agree if the requirements of the solution are provided through the services
offered by the tool being evaluated.

Taking these considerations into account, the PU is now called estimated utility
(EU). That utility can be estimated analyzing the satisfaction of the system

123

functional requirements, which is a low-complexity technical activity. A simple
method that can be used to verify if the system supports those requirements is to
compare both factors through a correspondence matrix, also known as traceability
matrix (Kannenberg and Saiedian 2009);
requirements versus
services provided by the system. In order to ﬁll out that matrix, evaluators must
check and record if each functional requirement is supported by some system
service. Then, the system EU comes directly from the resulting matrix. Eventually
evaluators could experience the system (if available), analyze it, and after being
familiar with it, they can deﬁne if the system provides the necessary services to
satisfy the requirements. Table 1 shows an example of a comparative matrix to
illustrate this point.

functional

i.e.

The table allows to quickly check that all functional requirements are addressed
by the system services, since there must be at least an ‘‘X’’ in every column (ESA
Board 1991). The ‘‘X’’ indicates which service is able to deal with every functional
requirement from the user or the client. The idea is to obtain a number from this
matrix, which represents the percentage of supported requirements. Additionally, a
weight can be assigned to each requirement according to its importance and priority.
This may be a simple yet suitable weighting scale for requirements: 4—critical; 3—
high; 2—normal; 1—low; 0—very low. The percentage of supported features comes
from the next formula:

P

%R ¼

Þ

n¼1 In  Sn
ð
N
P
n¼1 Inð Þ

N

ð2Þ

where In is the weight of the requirement n, and Sn represents the support provided
by the system to deal with the requirement n. Adopting these considerations, collaborative 
technology characteristics can be considered as a requirement. For
example, in a collaborative text editor, showing the name of other members who are

editing a document simultaneously (i.e. the buddy list) could be an important
requirement to be supported by the system.

Another important factor that should be considered in the model is the estimated
usability (EUSA). A system could support all functional requirements, however if its
usability does not overcome a certain minimum level, then we can assume that the
solution will not be used in a real work scenario. Therefore the EUSA will directly
affect the EU.

This usability is a subjective variable that involves a minimum threshold of
acceptability; therefore evaluators have to make usability pre-tests of the system
[like in Wideband Delphi (Potter and Sakry 2002)], in order to determine together
whether or not this EUSA overpasses an acceptable minimum level. The EU is then
generated as a binary number equal to: 1—if the percentage of accomplished
requirements is enough to support the task, and the EUSA is acceptable; and 0—in
other cases. Figure 7 summarizes how to calculate the EU, based on the previous
deﬁnitions.

Fig. 7 Proposed strategy to

123

Technology acceptance in e-Business environments

221

In this evaluation context, the concept of system considers both hardware and
software due to the tight relationship existing between them. For example, a user
who feels comfortable using a text editor on a desktop computer will not necessarily
feel comfortable using that same editor on a smartphone. This deﬁnition of a system
has to be extended to cover the collaborative features of the tool being evaluated.
Using the same example, a user who feels at ease working with other users and
collaborating with them will not necessarily feel comfortable using a collaborative
text editor. Therefore, it is important to consider all these factors in a comprehensive
way: if one factor changes (positively or negatively), it may affect the global user’s
perception about the system.

3.2 Perceived ease-of-use

Let us consider now the PEOU of an IT solution. It seems that being easy to use is
not enough to choose a system,
if it does not satisfy the stated functional
requirements, because in that case the system is not providing any utility. Therefore,
EU is a main factor to be considered and PEOU is just a moderating factor (Fig. 8).
If EU reaches an acceptable value for evaluators, then PEOU can be measured.
For instance, if a company must choose between two alternative systems A and B to
support a certain process, then their ﬁrst step is to verify if these systems satisfy the
functional requirements established by the users and clients. If system A does but B
does not, then it is irrelevant if B is easier to use than A. Otherwise, if both systems
roughly satisfy the same set of requirements, then PEOU can be used to choose the
best option.

The next question that arises is: which variables should be considered to
determine the PEOU factor? Analyzing TAM extended models, there are two
variables of TAM3 that can be considered for doing that: anxiety and self-efﬁcacy.
These variables are proposed to measure system usability. Particularly, anxiety is
related with affectivity regarding the system use. This factor is important for the
EBTAM model since we cannot count on signiﬁcant users’ experience as discussed
above, and the anxiety allows us to determine the users’ predisposition concerning
the system.

We would also like to use the positive affectivity variable to determine users’
anxiety. A low value of that variable may signal negative affectivity or anxiety of
the users respect to the new system.

On the other hand, self-efﬁcacy is related with abilities that users think they have
to use the system. This variable is somehow related with the experience factor of
other models. We cannot make experience (in the new IT solution) as a factor,
because frequently users have little of it or none at all in our scenario. However, we

Fig. 8 Basic structure of
EBTAM

123

222

D. Leyton et al.

Fig. 9 PEOU estimation in EBTAM

have to consider it in some way due to its relevance for the proposed model.
Counting on some limited experience with the system is better than none, and that
should be captured by the model.

In order to include the experience in the EBTAM model, we could try to
inﬂuence PEOU somehow without making this variable a formal factor of the
model. Experience does not affect affectivity because it
is related with a
predisposition. However, experience could inﬂuence self-efﬁcacy. If users have
experience using the new system, their beliefs about their abilities using it are
credible. Considering these assumptions, Fig. 9 shows experience as a moderating
factor of self-efﬁcacy: if available, it will allow the users to estimate their selfefﬁcacy 
in a more accurate way.

At this stage, factors related with users’ collaboration abilities have to be
integrated to the proposed model. If a user has the ability to collaborate with a
group, then he/she can give and receive help on system usage. Therefore the user
weaknesses can be covered by other members of the group, and the difﬁculty of
using the system can be reduced if users know how to collaborate.

The same variables deﬁned to predict the system adoption are also proposed to
determine users’ collaboration abilities (Fig. 9). Affectivity will measure the
predisposition to work in group and collaborate. Self-efﬁcacy will measure the
abilities that users think they have to collaborate with other members of the team. In
this case, experience can be determined more accurately since users know about
their own experience in collaboration and team work. With these deﬁnitions and
choices, EBTAM computes PEOU based on a questionnaire applied to users.

123

3.3 Work hypotheses

Since the previous description of EBTAM is made on a tentative basis, it is
necessary to validate the assumptions made. Therefore we have deﬁned various
work hypotheses, which are presented below and also indicated on the structure of
EBTAM (Fig. 10).

Self-efﬁcacy using the system affects positively to PEOU. This relationship is

H1
moderated by the experience using the system.

H2 Affectivity using the system affects positively to PEOU.

Self-efﬁcacy working in team affects positively to PEOU. This relationship is

H3
moderated by the experience working in teams.

H4 Affectivity for working in teams affects positively to PEOU.

H5 Assuming than EU is acceptable for evaluators (value is 1), BI is positively
inﬂuenced by PEOU.

H6 BI positively affects system use.

Finally, a general hypothesis is proposed:

H7 EBTAM can explain BI with a coefﬁcient of determination [0.3.

4 EBTAM evaluation

A pilot evaluation was applied to ten people from various professional environments
using a questionnaire, as a way to detect ambiguities and difﬁcult-to-answer
questions. A reﬁned instrument (i.e. questionnaire) was obtained after considering
the comments from the volunteers. That instrument is available at (Leyton 2013).
The new questionnaire, which measures the factors considered in EBTAM, was
applied in three work scenarios of typical Chilean e-Business SMOs. The ﬁrst one
was a medium-sized company, which was intending to deploy a framework to
develop mobile applications for e-Business. The questionnaire was applied to 29
employees (potential users). In this scenario, use of the system is compulsory, so
users do not have other options; therefore, BI was considered as a measure of
success instead of actual use. Three employees of the company were the evaluators.
The second evaluation was done in a medium-sized technology company that
was trying to adopt a version control system to support its employees’ activities.
The questionnaire was applied to 19 workers. In this scenario, use of the system was
not compulsory, therefore the users have other options to address their needs. Thus,
the use of the system can be considered as a measure of success. Three company
employees were the evaluators.

The third evaluation involved a small/medium company, which intended to
replace their current text editor with the GoogleDocs system in order to edit texts
collaboratively. The questionnaire was applied to all their 14 workers. Like the
previous case, the use of the system was not an obligation, therefore the system
usage represents a measure of success. Two company workers were the evaluators.
For these three scenarios, a ﬁrst part of the questionnaire was applied before
deploying the new system to capture the independent variables. Then, after
1.5 months using the new system, the second part of the survey was asked to the
users. Finally, after 9 months using the system, the second part of the questionnaire
was applied again in order to see if the values obtained for the different coefﬁcients
changed with time. The questionnaire items that allow determining each coefﬁcient
were tuned considering the context of each case, as a way to ease the task for the
end-users.

These questionnaires measure PEOU considering the coefﬁcients indicated in
Fig. 10, and they were implemented using the GoogleDocs Forms tool to ease the
answering process. The usefulness estimation (EU) was measured using the
previously described matrix (i.e. the users’ requirements vs. the services provided
by the system).

4.1 Obtained results

The XLSTAT software (Sharpe et al. 2013) was used to analyze the obtained
results. Each item of the questionnaire can be answered using a 5-point scale, where
the minimum value is 0 and the maximum is 4. The ﬁnal value for each variable
comes from averaging the answers to the various questionnaire items associated to
the variable. A Cronbach alpha analysis was used to determine the reliability of the
survey. Table 2 shows the results of this analysis, where the highest values were

obtained by PEOU (i.e. the perceived ease of use) and system affectivity (i.e. the
users’ predisposition for using the system), and the lowest value was collaboration
self-efﬁcacy (i.e. users’ abilities to work in teams).

Table 3 shows descriptive statistics about the values obtained at the ﬁrst stage of
the evaluation process, i.e. when the system is going to be acquired or developed.
The PEOU, BI and Use are also shown for the remaining two stages (i.e. after 1.5
and 9 months respectively). We deﬁned these three stages to try to identify not only
the expected usability and usefulness of the system before entering into production
(measured at stage 1), but also afterwards; in the short (stage 2) and medium term
(stage 3). After 9 months of using a system we could assume that the user will have
a deﬁnitive assessment of the system usability and usefulness. The considered

123

variables in these observations are those that characterize the system and team
according to the EBTAM model (see Fig. 10).

The values in Table 3 indicate that the experience of working in teams is the
factor with highest average value. A reason could be that nowadays most companies
hire workers with collaboration abilities, and also because collaboration is involved
in most activities they do every day. Moreover, this factor has the lowest coefﬁcient
of variation, which indicates the potential users tend to have an agreement about this
point.

Something completely different happens with Experience using the System: its
coefﬁcient of variation is the highest among all analyzed factors. This probably
means that this coefﬁcient is not easy to estimate by the users, particularly if they do
not know the system being evaluated. A high standard deviation in any coefﬁcient
indicates that an extra evaluation mechanism should be used to determine an
acceptable value for that coefﬁcient. Like previous cases, we can use a kind of
Wideband Delphi process (Potter and Sakry 2002) to deal with this problem.

Considering the second stage, i.e. after 1.5 months of system utilization, another
important factor appears: the system use. This coefﬁcient has a variation of 0.46,
which is a high value considering other factors in the model. A reason to explain
that situation could be the few observations that we had to determine the value of
this factor. However, during the third evaluation stage (i.e. after 9 months using the
system),
this value decreases to 0.26. This means that users, with additional

experience, have a more homogeneous appraisal of the system. As we can expect,
the average values for the PEOU, BI and Use tend to improve while the users gain
experience utilizing the system.

Considering the values obtained in the second and third evaluation we can
observe that they do not change much, and the dispersion become smaller. This
means the ﬁrst evaluation, which represents little effort for the SMO, delivers values
that are sound enough to make acceptable predictions about a particular IT adoption.
Tables 4 and 5 show the correlation analysis; it is classiﬁed in two types. The ﬁrst
one includes all experiments, but leaving out the use factor (Table 4). The second
one is the voluntary scenario, including the use factor (Table 5). Values in boldface
in Tables 4 and 5 have a signiﬁcance level of alpha equal or below 0.05. The
variables are abbreviated as follows: System Affectivity (AFF), Experience Using
the System (EXP), Self-Efﬁcacy using the System (AEF), Affectivity working in
Teams (TAFF), Experience working in Teams (TEXP) and Self-Efﬁcacy working in
Teams (TAEF).

Analyzing Tables 4 and 5 we can see that System Affectivity has a positive and
signiﬁcant correlation with all factors, except with the Experience using the System
(see Table 4). This shows the importance of this factor in the model. The same
happens with Affectivity to work in Teams.

The opposite happens with the Experience using the System; by itself, it does not
have a signiﬁcant correlation almost with any factor. This is consistent with

123

228

D. Leyton et al.

hypothesis H1 that indicates the Experience using the System is a moderating
variable; thus by itself it gives no information about the use, or how users may feel
with it. A user may not have experience using a system, but he/she can be excited
about its use, and he/she can learn to use it. By contrast, a user may have much
experience using a system and this can be an argument for him/her to assert it is hard
to use.

therefore it

Experience working in teams differs from experience using the system. This
variable has more signiﬁcant and positive correlations with other factors. A reason
could be that the experience working in teams generally improves the user’s
improves the self-efﬁcacy and willingness
collaboration abilities;
(affectivity) about this kind of work. Moreover, it also helps to have a higher
willingness to use the system, because users will work with that team, which will
impact positively the affectivity towards the system. The same reason explains that
self-efﬁcacy and affectivity working in teams possess signiﬁcant and positive
correlations with most factors in the model. As expected, BI and PEOU are
signiﬁcantly and positively related.

After 1.5 months using the system (i.e. during the second evaluation stage), the
use factor does not have signiﬁcant correlation with PEOU. It does not have a
signiﬁcant correlation with BI either. However, after 9 months using the system (i.e.
the third evaluation stage), these correlations are signiﬁcant and positive. The
explanation for this change could be that now users are more experienced and thus
they have a more consistent idea of the system. Therefore, users perceive the system
as useful and thus they use it. The same is concluded with the BI: they have the
intention to use the system and thus they use it.

4.2 Model validation

ANOVA variance analysis was done to validate the model and ﬁnd values for the
factors that compose it. Table 6 shows the results of the linear regression over
PEOU. Just variables associated with the system contributed to PEOU explanation.
Therefore, factors related with the team, which are not good predictors for PEOU,
can be removed from the model (see Fig. 10) and considered (when needed) as part
of the functional requirements to be addressed by the system to be adopted by the
SMO.

We can observe in Table 6 that the determination coefﬁcient is 0.43 after
1.5 months using the system, and 0.27 after 9 months; they are both lower than the
TAM3 coefﬁcient which explains 52 % of PEOU variance; thus EBTAM is less
effective explaining the variability of PEOU than TAM3. However, this is evidence
to accept H1 and H2, but H3 and H4 should be rejected. Also, these results prove the
model is more effective predicting PEOU immediately after the adoption of an IT
solution. After that period the users’ expectations evolve in particular directions,
depending on the role played by the users in the processes being supported by the
adopted system. Moreover, after 9 months the users had much experience with the
system and consequently, their original prediction on the ease of use decreased with
their more informed opinion on the system facilities.

Table 7 shows the results of the linear regression over BI. PEOU is a good
predictor of BI: it explains 32 % of its variance (it is important to remember that
users assumed the system was useful) after 1.5 months using the system, and 61 %
after 9 months. TAM2 and TAM3 explained almost 52 % and UTAUT explained
70 %, therefore, on the average, the proposed model is less effective for explaining
BI. However EBTAM is easier to be applied and also less expensive than the other
models, which clearly contributes to be used in SMO.

These numbers show evidence to accept hypothesis H5. Also, these results show
the model is more effective predicting BI from PEOU on a longer period than in the
short term. This can be explained because after 9 months, users have had a long
period to convince themselves on their intention to use the system based on their
perceived system ease of use.

Table 8 shows the results of the linear regression over use. BI is a good predictor
of the system use; it explained 46 % of its variance after 1.5 months using the
system, and 49 % after 9 months, showing a small difference between both periods
for this variable. These results are consistent with TAM3 that explains 35 % of the
variance of use. Therefore, there is evidence to accept hypothesis H6. Finally,
Figs. 11 and 12 show the model with the corresponding coefﬁcients, after 1.5 and
9 months, respectively.

4.3 Discussion

The hypothesis H7 could be proved (see Table 8). The rest of the speciﬁc
hypotheses were also proved, except two of them. The rejected hypotheses (i.e. H3
and H4) concern teamwork. Teamwork is not something that directly affects the
usability of the system, e.g. someone who works well in teams could ﬁnd the system
difﬁcult to use. By contrast, someone who has insufﬁcient skills to work in teams
could see the system as an opportunity to improve relationships with other members
of the group. In this case, IT would work as a facilitator for users to work in teams.
Thus, it is more appropriate to consider teamwork in combination with the system,
rather than as a variable by itself.

123

Technology acceptance in e-Business environments

231

This is consistent with the deﬁnition of a system that represents a combination of
software, hardware and team. With these variables out of the model, EBTAM is
now even simpler than before (Figs. 13, 14). As we can see in these ﬁgures, if we
take out the variables related to the team, the ﬁnal model and its b coefﬁcients are
not considerably affected.

Comparing with existing models, we can say that the others are more robust and
effective than EBTAM. Those models explain a higher percentage of the variances
of the dependent variables than EBTAM. This makes sense, because the other
models are considering more variables and relationships among them. However
EBTAM is simpler, less expensive to apply and imposes very few restrictions to be
used. Thus it is highly appropriate for small and medium-sized organizations
(SMOs).

EBTAM avoids using variables such as output quality, result demonstrability or
effort expectancy, which need that users know the system before applying the
model. This fact makes EBTAM easier to implement than the others, because it
does not require users’ experience with the system (except for the evaluators).
Therefore, the application of this evaluation model is also less time consuming that
the previous ones. This is a signiﬁcant advantage of EBTAM when it has to be used
in SMO.

The most demanding requirement for the applicability of the model is ﬁnding a
pair of persons in the company needed to estimate the functionalities and system
usability. These people have to be familiarized with the system. These evaluators
also have to adapt the questionnaire to the context in which it will be applied. Our
experience with acceptance cases suggests that it is always desirable to count on at
least one person within the organization, who is knowledgeable about
the

technology to be adopted. That person can validate the results given by the
predictive model, which is always important before getting involved in an IT
adoption initiative. If the results are aligned with this person’s opinion, then he/she
can help determine the best option to perform the transition between the current and
the future work scenario. In fact, the more knowledge the small or medium-sized
enterprise has about a new technology, the more likely it will be to adopt it
(Raymond 2001; Zhu et al. 2006).

Another aspect that should be considered in the IT adoption is the temporality of
the diagnosis. Any IT solution has a lifecycle that is directly linked to the current
context of the organization that is adopting the solution (Chandana 2010). Since the
context changes with time,
the suitability of these solutions for a particular
organization also changes (Dattee 2007; Borges et al. 2007).

5 Conclusions and future work

The e-Business environment is dynamic, collaborative and its supporting software is
changing all the time, according to the evolution of technology and business
opportunities. e-Business organizations have to deal with this issue and also with
other highly competitive service providers.

In this scenario it is then natural to think that the supporting systems and services
provided by an organization will evolve frequently as a way to address the needs or
opportunities of the market. Flexible and early adopters of new IT solutions usually
have an advantage over their competitors. However, wrong decisions about
technology adoption could make an organization to lose market and competitiveness.

123

Technology acceptance in e-Business environments

233

This is particularly critical for SMOs, which have few human and economic
resources to address these challenges, since wrong decisions can affect the continuity
of their operations.

The existing models to predict adoption of IT solutions help to make the right
decisions, but they are heavy-weighted for SMO. Therefore these models typically
cannot be used to make on-time adoptions.

This paper presents the EBTAM which intends to overcome this limitation.
EBTAM predicts user acceptance of IT solutions in SMO, which are most of the
organizations in the e-Business area. Provided that the target population usually has
few resources (mainly time, money and personnel), the model is simple, easy to use,
and its application involves just a low effort.

The application of the model begins with a binary assessment of the satisfaction
of the system requirements. If they are satisﬁed, then a perceived ease of use
(PEOU) variable is computed from answers to a questionnaire applied to employees.
PEOU is calculated from three more basic variables: Experience with System Use,
Self-Efﬁcacy with the System and Affectivity with the System. Once PEOU is
computed, this value is input to the computation of BI and the predicted use, such as
in the traditional TAM model (Davis 1989).

The model is directly applicable in the case of pondering whether to acquire a
new system or not. It may be more difﬁcult to apply when studying whether to
develop a new system or not; in that case, evaluators and users should have
available at least prototypes or mock-ups of the future system.

the employees, whereas it was voluntary in the other

The model was validated with cases occurring in three Small/Medium enterprises
dealing with e-Business. In one of these companies, the use of the new system was
compulsory for
two
companies. Furthermore, questions to the users were asked at three distinct points in
time: before the system was deployed, 1.5 months after deployment, and 9 months
after deployment. This strategy served to detect initial expectations, experience with
initial use, and experience after some time when the context probably may have
changed.

Although the preliminary results are highly encouraging, the model needs to be
applied in more organizations to determine its real strengths and weaknesses. Since
the experimental work was done with Chilean companies, we cannot ensure the
model suitability (per se) to other cultures. A next step in this research initiative
considers applying EBTAM in a larger number of enterprises, even in other
countries. The EBTAM model can also be used to determine the suitability of
technological solutions supporting collaborative processes similar to e-Business.
