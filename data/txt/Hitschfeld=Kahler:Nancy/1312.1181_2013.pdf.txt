Abstract

Mixed elements meshes based on the modiﬁed octree approach contain 
several co-spherical point conﬁgurations. While generating Delaunay
tessellations to be used together with the ﬁnite volume method, it is not
necessary to partition them into tetrahedra; co-spherical elements can be
used as ﬁnal elements. This paper presents a study of all co-spherical
elements that appear while tessellating a 1-irregular cuboid (cuboid with
at most one Steiner point on its edges) with diﬀerent aspect ratio. Steiner
points can be located at any position between the edge endpoints. When
Steiner points are located at edge midpoints, 24 co-spherical elements
appear while tessellating 1-irregular cubes. By inserting internal faces
√
and edges to these new elements, this number is reduced to 13. When
1-irregular cuboids with aspect ratio equal to
2 are tessellated, 10 cospherical 
elements are required. If 1-irregular cuboids have aspect ratio
between 1 and
2, all the tessellations are adequate for the ﬁnite volume
method. When Steiner points are located at any position, the study was
done for a speciﬁc Steiner point distribution on a cube. 38 co-spherical
elements were required to tessellate all the generated 1-irregular cubes.
Statistics about the impact of each new element in the tessellations of
1-irregular cuboids are also included. This study was done by developing 
an algorithm that construct Delaunay tessellations by starting from a
Delaunay tetrahedral mesh built by Qhull.

Introduction

Scientiﬁc and engineering problems are usually modeled by a set of partial differential 
equations and the solution to these partial diﬀerential equations is
calculated through the use of numerical methods. In order to get good results,
the object being modeled (domain) must be discretized in a proper way respecting 
the requirements imposed by the used numerical method. The discretization
(mesh) is usually composed of simple cells (basic elements) that must represent
the domain in the best possible way. In particular, we are interested in meshes
for the ﬁnite volume method [1] which are formed by polygons (in a 2D domain)

or polyhedra (in a 3D domain), that satisfy the Delaunay condition: the circumcircle 
in 2D, or circumsphere in 3D, of each element does not contain any
other mesh point in its interior [2]. The Delaunay condition is required because
we use its dual structure, the Voronoi diagram, to model the control volumes
in order to compute an approximated solutions. The basic elements used so
far are triangles and quadrilaterals in 2D, and tetrahedra, cuboids, prisms and
pyramids in 3D. Meshes composed of diﬀerent elements types are called mixed
element meshes [3].
Mixed element meshes are built on 2D or 3D domains described by sets of
points, polygons or polyhedra depending on the application. We have developed
a mixed element mesh generator [4] based on an extension of octrees [5, 6]. Our
approach starts enclosing the domain in the smallest bounding box (cuboid).
Second, this cuboid is continuously reﬁned, at any edge position, by using the
geometry information of the domain. That is why this reﬁnement is called intersection 
based approach. Once this step ﬁnishes, an initial non-conforming mesh
composed of tetrahedra, pyramids, prisms, and cuboids is generated that ﬁts
the domain geometry. Third, these elements are further reﬁned by bisection, as
far as possible, until the density requirements are fulﬁlled. Fourth, the mesh is
done 1-irregular by allowing only one Steiner point on each edge. The current
solution is based on patterns but only the most frequently used patterns are
available. Then, if a pattern is not available or the element can not be properly
tessellated for the ﬁnite volume method, new Steiner points are inserted until
all 1-irregular elements can be properly tessellated. The current set of seven
ﬁnal elements is shown in Figure 1.

The advantage of using a mixed mesh in comparison with a tetrahedral mesh
is that the use of diﬀerent element types reduce the amount of edges, faces and
elements in the ﬁnal mesh. For example, we do not need to divide a cuboid into
tetrahedra. On the other hand, a disadvantage is that the equations must be

condition, (b) the same mixed mesh and its associated Voronoi diagram.

discretized using diﬀerent elements.
Octree based approaches naturally produces co-spherical point sets. A mixed
mesh satisfying the Delaunay condition can include all produced co-spherical
elements as shown in Figure 2. The ﬁnal elements in this example are ﬁve pyramids 
and four tetrahedra.
The goal of this paper is to study the co-spherical elements that can appear
while tessellating 1-irregular cuboids generated by using a bisection and intersection 
based approach and to analyze how useful would be to include the new
elements in the ﬁnal element set. In particular, this paper gives the number
and shape of new co-spherical elements needed to tessellate (a) all 1-irregular
cuboids generated by the bisection approach and (b) some particular 1-irregular
cuboids generated by the intersection reﬁnement approach. In addition, statistics 
associated with particular tessellations are presented such as the frequency
each co-spherical element is used and the number of tessellations that can be
used with the ﬁnite volume method without adding extra vertices. The analysis 
of the 1-irregular cuboid tessellations was done under diﬀerent criteria that
aﬀect the amount of generated co-spherical elements.
We have focused this work on the analysis of the tessellations of 1-irregular
cuboids because this element is the one that more frequently appears when
meshes are generated by a modiﬁed octree approach. A theoretical study on
the number of diﬀerent 1-irregular cuboid conﬁgurations that can appear either
by using a bisection or an intersection based approach was published in [7]. We
use the results of that work as starting point for this study.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the bisection and intersection 
reﬁnement approaches. Section 3 presents brieﬂy the developed algorithm
to compute Delaunay tessellations. Section 4 and Section 5 give the results
obtained by applying the algorithm to 1-irregular cuboids generated by a bisection 
and an intersection based approach, respectively. Section 6 includes our
conclusions.

2 Basic concepts

This section describes some ideas in order to understand how 1-irregular cuboids
are generated.

2.1 Bisection based approach 1-irregular conﬁgurations

In this approach, the Steiner points inserted at the reﬁnement phase are always
located at the edge midpoints. Cuboids can be reﬁned into two, four or eight
smaller cuboids as shown in Figure 3.
This reﬁnement produces neighboring cuboids with Steiner points located at the
edge midpoints. Those 1-irregular cuboids are larger than the already reﬁned
neighbor cuboid as shown in Figure 4.

2.2

Intersection based approach 1-irregular conﬁgurations

While using an intersection based approach, the Steiner points are not necessarily 
located at the edge midpoints. In general, there are no constrains on the
location of the Steiner points, except by the fact that parallel edges must be
divided in the same relative position to ensure the generation of cuboids and
not any other polyhedron. Figure 5 shows an example of this approach.
This reﬁnement produces neighboring cuboids with Steiner points located at
any edge position. Those 1-irregular cuboids are larger than the already reﬁned
neighbor cuboid as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 6: The intersection-reﬁned cuboid to the left produces an 1-irregular
element like the cuboid to the right.

3 Algorithm

In order to count the number of new co-spherical elements than can appear
and to recognize their shape, we have developed an algorithm that executes the
followings steps:

1. Build the point conﬁguration of a 1-irregular cuboid by specifying the

coordinates of the cuboid vertices and its Steiner points.

2. Build a Delaunay tetrahedral mesh for this point conﬁguration by using

QHull [8]1.

3. Join tetrahedra to form the largest possible co-spherical elements.

4. Identify each ﬁnal co-spherical polyhedron.

Qhull divides co-spherical point conﬁgurations into a set of tetrahedra by adding
an artiﬁcial point that is not part of the input. Then, we use this fact to
recognize the faces that form a co-spherical polyhedron and later to recognize
which element is.

4 Results: Bisection based approach

This section describes the results obtained by applying the previous algorithm to
the 4096 (212) 1-irregular conﬁgurations that can be generated using a bisection
based approach. First, the new co-spherical elements are shown. Then, their
impact in all the tessellations is analyzed and ﬁnally, the tessellations that can
be used with the ﬁnite volume method are characterized.

4.1 New co-spherical elements

We have identiﬁed 17 new co-spherical polyhedra in the tessellations of 1irregular 
cubes in addition to the seven original elements shown in Figure 1.
A description of each one can be found in Table 1. A distinction is made between 
rectangular and quadrilateral faces except for the quadrilateral pyramid.
Because of this, the triangular prism and the generic element #1 are considered
diﬀerent co-spherical elements, and the same happens between the deformed
prism and the generic element # 3. This could be changed in a future study.

4.2 Element analysis

Since there are 17 new co-spherical elements, the natural question is if this
number can be reduced without adding diagonals in the cuboid rectangular
faces. In fact, our mixed element mesh generator requires to tessellate 1-irregular
cuboids without adding diagonals on its rectangular faces when it uses a patternwise 
approach. In the following, we analyze the number of co-spherical elements
under three diﬀerent criteria:

• Finding the optimal tessellation: An optimal tessellation contains
the lowest amount of ﬁnal elements. This is reached by maximizing the
number of elements with diﬀerent shape. The number of co-spherical
elements that can be used is 24.

• Minimizing the number of diﬀerent co-spherical elements by
adding only internal faces: Under this criterion we want to reduce
the number of diﬀerent ﬁnal elements by adding only internal faces. ExStudy 
on Delaunay tessellations

amining the set of new elements in Table 1, we see that the bipyramids
and the biprisms are naturally divisible into two elements, and so are the
generic #5 (separable into a prism and a quadrilateral pyramid), generic
#8 (separable into a prism and two quadrilateral pyramids) and generic
#9 (separable into a cuboid and quadrilateral pyramid), among others.
An example of this type of separation is shown in Figure 7. The total
number of co-spherical elements needed to tessellate the 4096 conﬁgurations 
is now 16.

Figure 7: Generic #9 element and its separation into two diﬀerent elements.

• Minimizing the number of diﬀerent co-spherical elements by
adding internal edges and faces: This extends the second criterion
by adding the condition that it is possible to add extra edges only if they
are inside the new elements. The reason for only allowing internal edges
is that adding external edges could change the partition of one of the rectangular 
faces of the original cuboid. Under this criterion, the elements
that are separable are generic #3 (one inner edge produces two tetrahedra 
and one quadrilateral pyramid), generic #6 (one inner edge produces
two tetrahedra and a tetrahedron complement) and generic #7 (two inner
edges produce two tetrahedra, a quadrilateral pyramid and a deformed
prism). An example of this type of separation is shown in Figure 8. The
total number of co-spherical elements needed to tessellate the 4096 conﬁgurations 
is reduced to 13.

4.3 Evaluating the impact of each new element

In order to decide how important is to include a new element in the ﬁnal element
set, in this section we study how many times each co-spherical element appears
√
in the tessellation of a 1-irregular cuboid. For this study, we have run our
program for 1-irregular cuboids with three diﬀerent aspect ratio: 1, 4, and
2.
• Test case A. Aspect ratio equal to 1 (a = b = c): The 1-irregular cube
appears naturally on the standard octree and this method is used by most
mesh generators based on octrees.

Figure 8: Generic #6 element and its separation into three diﬀerent elements
by adding an extra inner edge shown in blue.

• Test case B. Aspect ratio equal to 4 (4a = 2b = c): This represents a

typical cuboid to model thin zones.
• Test case C. Aspect ratio equal to

√

√
2 (a

2 = b = c): It was shown in [9]
that some 1-irregular cuboid within these proportions can be tessellated
without problems for the ﬁnite volume method.

From Table 2, we observe that the most used elements correspond to tetrahedra 
and quadrilateral pyramids (∼49.5% and ∼31.5% of the total elements,
respectively). Moreover, the set of seven initial co-spherical elements represents
∼95.6% of the total. If the number of co-spherical elements is reduced to 16 by
adding internal faces, the element frequencies are distributed as shown in Table

7 elements is not separable by adding internal edges or faces.

4.4 Tessellations and the ﬁnite volume method

We have also examined whether the generated tessellations meet the requirements 
for their use in the context of the ﬁnite volume method. The requirement
is that the circumcenter of each ﬁnal element is contained within the initial 1irregular 
cuboid. This requirement is strong but it allows our mesh generator
to ﬁnd a proper tessellation of each 1-irregular cuboid locally.
The evaluation of each tessellation is performed on the same test cases discussed
in Section 4.2. The results are shown in Table 8. We observe that the circumcenters 
of all elements are inside the initial cuboid for all the conﬁgurations in
the test cases A and C. This means that all 1-irregular conﬁgurations could be
properly tessellated if the aspect ratio of the elements is less or equal to
2. If
1-irregular cuboids has an aspect ratio equal to 4, only 132 1-irregular cuboids
ﬁt the circumcenter requirement.

5 Results: Intersection based approach

The number of 1-irregular conﬁgurations that can appear while reﬁning cuboids
by an intersection based approach is 1873 + 1 [7]. We consider that two 1irregular 
conﬁgurations are diﬀerent if the relative position of Steiner points
located on parallel cuboid edges is not the same. In this section we describe the
results obtained by applying the algorithm to all 1-irregular conﬁgurations of
a cube that can be generated by inserting Steiner points only on the positions
deﬁned by multiples of 1/16 of the edge length. The impact of each co-spherical
element was only obtained for the 1-irregular cube.

5.1 New co-spherical elements

Since the possible positions of Steiner points on a particular edge are inﬁnite,
we only use a set of predetermined Steiner point positions for each set of cuboid
parallel edges deﬁned as follows:

• The ﬁrst vertex is always located at the midpoint of an edge.
• If the k-th point is located to the left of the k − 1 previous points, its
actual position is located at the midpoint of the segment deﬁned by the
left edge corner and the leftmost already assigned Steiner point. Similarly,
if the k-th point is located to the right, its actual position is determined
by the midpoint of the segment deﬁned by the rightmost assigned Steiner
point and the right edge corner.

• If the relative position of the k-th point is between two Steiner points
already allocated, its actual position is determined by the midpoint of the
two Steiner points.

Under this approach we identiﬁed 14 new co-spherical elements in the tessellations 
of 1-irregular cubes. A description of each of them can be found in
Table 9.

The trend observed in the bisection based approach is also observed here: the
most used elements are tetrahedra and quadrilateral pyramids (∼85.15% and
∼11.19% of total elements respectively, corresponding to more than 96%). The
initial set of seven elements represents a ∼96.98%, while the set of 24 elements
found in conﬁgurations under the bisection based approach covers a ∼99.93%.
Finally, the elements that appear exclusively under the intersection based approach 
represent only a ∼0.07% of the total.

6 Conclusions

We have identiﬁed 24 co-spherical elements while tessellating 1-irregular cubes
generated by a bisection based approach and 38 co-spherical elements while
tessellating 1-irregular cubes generated by an intersection based approach. We
have experimentally noticed that in the tessellation of 1-irregular cubes (aspect
ratio equal to 1) more co-spherical elements appear than in the tessellation of 1irregular 
cuboids with larger aspect ratio. When we increase the cuboid aspect
ratio a subset of these co-spherical elements is required and no new co-spherical
element appears.
We have studied the tessellations of 1-irregular cuboids generated by a bisection
2, and 4. The results can

We would need to add 6 co-spherical elements to the initial ﬁnal element
set if we want that our mixed element mesh generator can tessellate the
1-irregular cuboids the ﬁrst time the mesh is done 1-irregular.

• The number of diﬀerent co-spherical elements while tessellating 1-irregular
cubes can be reduced from 24 to 16 by adding internal faces and to 13
by adding internal faces and edges. While tessellating 1-irregular cuboids
2, the required elements are reduced from
with aspect ratio equal to
10 to 7 if we allow the insertion of internal faces. While tessellating 1irregular 
cuboids with aspect ratio equal to 4 only 6 co-spherical elements
are used.

We have also study the tessellations of 1-irregular cubes generated by an intersection 
based approach and 14 additional co-spherical elements appear. They
represent less than 0.07% of the total, then it not useful to include them in the
set of ﬁnal elements. They would increase this set in ∼58% (24 to 38).
It is worth to point out that the proposed algorithm was only applied for tessellating 
1-irregular cuboids but it can also be used without any modiﬁcation
to tessellate any 1-irregular convex conﬁguration: 1-irregular prisms, pyramids
or tetrahedra, among others. Moreover, the algorithm can be used to generate
Delaunay tessellations for any point set. It may be only required to recognize
new co-spherical conﬁgurations. This means we could apply this algorithm to
the points of a larger part of the 1-irregular mixed element mesh and not only to
the 1-irregular basic elements. The circumcenter requirement is only really necessary 
for 1-irregular elements that are located at the boundary or at a material
interface.
We have made the study under the assumption that all the 1-irregular conﬁgurations 
appear in the same rate, but this is for sure not true. While generating a
mesh based on modiﬁed octrees, there are some conﬁgurations that appear more
frequently than others. This fact could mean that some co-spherical elements
belonging to the tessellation of few 1-irregular cuboids, could have a greater
impact than the one we have computed if these few conﬁgurations appear very
frequently while generating a mesh. A complete study should consider also this
case.
The study presented here is very useful for our mesh generator based on modiﬁed
octrees, but we think that it can also be useful for other mesh generator based
on octrees.
