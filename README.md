[Link to the paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8609671)

## Data
- A labelled dataset of 1,126 author-scored keyphrases extracted from the text of papers coauthored
by 12 Computer Science professors, which can be found in [data/scored_keyphrases](https://github.com/burningreds/cstagclouds/tree/master/data/scored_keyphrases).
- An evaluation of four learning-to-rank frameworks using the above dataset, and a comparison of their results with an unsupervised keyphrase extraction framework, which can be found in [data/evaluation](https://github.com/burningreds/cstagclouds/tree/master/data/evaluation)
- Raw text data used for evaluation in [data/txt](https://github.com/burningreds/cstagclouds/tree/master/data/txt)
